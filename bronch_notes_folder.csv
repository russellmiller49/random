General Anesthesia
  
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via flexible bronchoscope
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was placed and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA. The vocal cords were edematous but open.  The patients known tracheal 12X20 Bonostent was visualized with the proximal edge abutting the distal aspect of the true vocal folds.  There was significant thick dry mucous with mild obstruction however the stent was otherwise patent. Just distal to the stent was a 4cm long complex tracheal stenosis with circumferential friable and edematous mucosa. An “A-shaped” deformity was visualized within the segment consistent with tracheal cartilage injury along with overlying granulation tissue creating a slit light obstruction of approximately 80% of the normal tracheal lumen. The mid to distal trachea was normal and full inspection of the distal tracheobronchial tree revealed no other abnormalities and all bronchial segments were widely patent to at least the 1st sub-segmental branch. The laryngeal mask airway was removed and a a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supra-glottic space. Rigid alligator forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced through the vocal cords into the subglottic space and attached the jet ventilator.  Balloon dilatation of the stenotic segment was performed with a phased 8-9-10 Merit dilatational balloon.  Due to the deformity and lack of cartilaginous structure this only provided mild additional benefit.  The 10 mm rigid bronchosocpe was then telescoped into the tracheoscope and approximated to the level of the most significant stenosis.  The beveled tip was used to gently debulk granulation tissue with an apple coring technique. At this point a 12 X 40 bonostent was placed under direct visualization with the proximal edge at the level of the cricoid cartilage about 2 cm distal to the true vocal folds and the distal edge 1 cm beyond the distal stenotic segment.  Balloon dilatation of stent was performed using a phased 12-13.5-15 Merit dilatational balloon.  Following dilatation the trachea was widely patent with a luminal diameter approximately 95% of the normal. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the LMA re-inserted. Final inspection of the airway was performed and images captures after which the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery. 

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction

INDICATIONS: Airway stent occlusion 

Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The patients known Silicone Y-stent was well positioned. There was signifigant thich dry mucous with mild obstruction of the tracheal limb, moderate obstruction of the left bronchial limb and significant obstruction of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease. On the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease. At the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time. Through a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents. Subsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.

"•	Procedure Name: Navigational Bronchoscopy and Staging EBUS
•	Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
•	Pre-operative diagnosis: Pulmonary Nodule
•	Post-operative Diagnosis: Pulmonary Nodule
•	Medications: General Anesthesia
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via an 8.5 ETT  and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The distal trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The Covidien superDimension locatable guide was then inserted through the working channel and registration was performed. The Edge 180 degree extended working channel was then attached to the bronchoscope.  Using navigational map we advanced the catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a diffuse heterogeneric concentric view within the lesion consistent with the known part solid nodule. Biopsies were then performed with peripheral needle under fluoroscopic visualization with ROSE findings consistent with malignancy, additional forceps biopsies were then performed in the same location.  
The flexible bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced via the ETT. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4L, 7 and 4R lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUS TBNA 22- and 25-gauge needles beginning with the 4L Lymph node (7 biopsies), followed by the 7 lymph node (5 biopsies) and finally the 4R lymph node (4 biopsies). ROSE evaluation was consistent with adequate lymph node sampling in all stations. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the T190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Active oozing was noted at the site of the 4R lymph node and topical iced saline was applied with subsequent resolution of the bleeding and after suctioning remaining  blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.
Complications: No immediate complications
•	Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc
•	Post Procedure A/P:
o	Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with peripheral navigation and endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
o	The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
o	Post- procedural CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
o	Given proximity of biopsy to pleura and plan to fly back to Japan on Thursday will have patient return for repeat CXR tomorrow out of an abundance of caution. 
o	Will await final pathology results.","{ ""patient_mrn"": ""UNKNOWN"", ""procedure_date"": ""2025-12-17"", ""procedure_start_time"": null, ""procedure_end_time"": null,

"Anesthesia/Medications:
•	General anesthesia with 8.5 ETT placement
•	Topical anesthesia- 6cc 1% lidocaine)
•	Additional intravenous medications per institutional protocol
Indications:
Bilateral lung masses 
Pre-Procedure Diagnosis: Suspected lung  malignancy
Post-Procedure Diagnosis: Suspected lung  malignancy
Consent:
The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient (or surrogate). Informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol.
Time-Out:
A formal time-out was performed confirming the patient’s identity, procedure, and site.
________________________________________
I. Initial Airway Inspection
Findings:
•	The flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the 8.5 ETT and advanced into the trachea.
•	The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina.
•	The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level.
•	Inspection notable for an endobronchial fungating mass in the RUL obstructing the superior and anterior segments.
•	The remaining airways appeared normal with no additional endobronchial abnormalities, mucosal irregularities, or abnormal secretions.
________________________________________
II. Tissue Sampling Procedures
A. Right Upper Lobe (RUL) Endobronchial Biopsy
•	An endobronchial mass was identified obstructing the superior and anterior segments of the RUL.
•	Sampling Techniques:
o	Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex transbronchial needle with five (5) passes.
o	Endobronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with six (6) samples obtained.
o	Hemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine.
B. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Lesion Biopsy
•	A second lesion was identified in the superior segment of the LLL using radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a concentric view.
•	Sampling Techniques:
o	Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex with four (4) passes.
o	Transbronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with five (5) samples obtained.
o	Hemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine.
C. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) - Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Superior Segment
•	A BAL was performed in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.
•	Instillation: 110 cc normal saline
•	Return: 20 cc
•	Samples sent for cytology, microbiology (bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures), and differential cell count.
D. Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE)
•	Right Upper Lobe (RUL) lesion: ROSE interpretation was malignant.
•	Left Lower Lobe (LLL) lesion: ROSE revealed abundant necrosis but pathology was unable to definitively confirm malignancy.
________________________________________
III. Final Airway Re-Inspection and Conclusion
Findings:
•	No active bleeding was noted on final airway inspection.
•	No evidence of airway compromise.
Estimated Blood Loss: Moderate, successfully controlled with topical epinephrine.
Complications: No immediate complications.
Disposition/Plan:
•	The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
•	Post-procedure CXR was performed to rule out pneumothorax or other complications.
•	Pathology, cytology, and microbiology results are pending.
•	Follow-up bronchoscopy and multidisciplinary evaluation will be planned based on final pathology results.","{ ""patient_mrn"": ""UNKNOWN"", ""procedure_date"": ""2025-10-27"", ""providers"": { ""attending_name"": ""Unknown"", ""assistant_role"": null, ""rose_present"": true }, ""metadata"": { ""schema_version"": ""2.0.0"", ""data_entry_status"": ""Complete"", ""notes"": ""Generated from clinical procedure note.

"ANESTHESIA:  General
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: Right lower lobe mass
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Explanation of the procedure and all risks, benefits, and options were discussed. The risks include but were not limited to bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax. All questions were answered. 
The patient was anesthetized with topical anesthesia and the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth where topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords and into the trachea. When adequate anesthesia was achieved, the bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and topical lidocaine administered on a local-regional fashion. The endobronchial tree was inspected and patient was found to have endobronchial lesion noted in the right lower lobe superior segment.  Multiple forceps biopsies were obtained at this time.  Lidocaine with epinephrine was instilled in addition to cold saline to achieve adequate hemostasis. ROSE at bedside confirmed adequate sample and possible evidence of malignancy.  The bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn and removed.
The endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords.  Staging ultrasound performed.  Measured on ultrasound the 11 L, 10 L, for now, 7, 4R, 10 R, 11RS and 11Ri.  Station 7 was greater than 5 mm and therefore was sampled by needle aspiration ×4.  ROSE at bedside confirmed adequate sample.  Bronchoscope was slowly withdrawn and removed.
Diagnostic bronchoscope passed through the vocal cords.  Tracheobronchial tree was examined adequate hemostasis was achieved.  Right lower lobe superior segment endobronchial lesion no longer bleeding.  Bronchoscope was slowly withdrawn and removed.
Complication: None
Impression:
1.  Right lower lobe superior segment endobronchial lesion
2.  Biopsies of 7 lymph node station
Recommendations: 
1.  Follow up final pathology of endobronchial lesion
2.  Will notify patient in regards to follow-up with primary pulmonologist","{

"INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  This is a 56 year old-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who presents with a cavitary lesion in right lower lobe.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm the patient’s identity, the procedure, and the location.
Following administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were identified on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were identified. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4 cc of epinephrine, 30 cc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage.
The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure was completed without further incident. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications. At the conclusion, he was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL from right lower lobe: Sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, cytology, and galactomannan.
Right lower lobe forceps biopsy: Sent for pathology and culture.
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Timothy Grace is a 56 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe.

COMPLICATIONS: None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.
Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.
Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. 
Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process
Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.
Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 

SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.
BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: This is a 74 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

"INDICATION FOR OPERATION: This  is a 68 old-year-old male who presents with multiple sub centimeter solid and cavitary pulmonary nodules.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Multiple Lung Nodule

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Multiple Lung Nodule
  
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia with local anesthesia (Lidocaine 1% solution, total 60 mg)
 
MONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENTS: 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Radial EBUS
Ion
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum Blood Loss
 
COMPLICATIONS:    Post-procedure PTX (no intervention required)
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Normal appearing airway and mucosa to the segmental level bilaterally
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Full registration was used.  

Target 1:   Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Lateral Basal Segment of RLL.  Target lesion is about .6 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. Endoscopically abnormal tissue could be visualized within the airway.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is unable to be visualized.  The following features were noted: aerated lung.
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE indicated inflammatory tissue with atypical cells. Samples sent for Cytology. Transbronchial biopsies were then performed with standard forceps in similar fashion. Samples were sent for histology and culture. 
 
Target 2: Ion robotic catheter was then used to engage the Posterior Segment of RUL.  Target lesion is about .5 cm in diameter and cavitary.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is unable to be visualized.  The following features were noted: aerated lung.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE was non-diagnostic. Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed in the RLL.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 30 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2) and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood clots. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. Post-operative CXR demonstrated moderate PTX which was stable on repeat in asymptomatic patient. Patient was discharged with close follow-up and instructions for parameters to seek emergency care.

"INDICATIONS:  1.Bronchus-intermedius obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a completely obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass. We were able to bypass the mass with the flexible bronchoscope and the distal airways were filled with purulent secretions consistent with post-obstructive pneumonia, the secretions were suctioned through the bronchoscope. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchi before attaching the monsoon JET ventilation. Using the flexible bronchoscope gentle manipulation resulting in brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical epinephrine and TXA. The mass was soft and somewhat pulsatile. We then inserted the linear EBUS bronchoscope into the airway and assessed the lesion with ultrasound. There was no obvious tumor seen and multiple vessels visualized in proximity to the lesion. At this point we decided to abort the procedure as endobronchial debulking would likely result in massive hemorrhage. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed from the airway and the procedure completed. Post-procedure a CT Angiogram of the chest was performed which showed purtruding submucosal broncholith with right middle and lower lobe atelectasis. There was also a very small apical pneumothorax which likely was caused by post-procedure coughing as no intervention was actually performed. 
Complications: Small pneumothorax, likely related to post-procedure coughing. 
Recommendations:
- Admit to IM ward
- Repeat CXR is 6 hours to assess pneumothorax
- Treat for post-obstructive pneumothorax with course of oral antibiotics
- I will reach out to thoracic surgeons at high volume centers to discuss possible surgical removal of broncholith. ","{

"Indications: adenopathy and multiple pulmonary nodules 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in the station 4R, 11R, 7 lymph nodes All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the right middle lobe to the area of known nodule and lesion distal endobronchial lesion was identified with both white light and radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of right lobe middle lobe nodule
- Successful EBUS bronchoscopy with biopsy  
- Await final pathology

"Indications: Chronic cough, history of BMT 
Medications: Fentanyl 125mcg, Versed 4mg  

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. There was normal vocal cord motion and no vocal cord lesions. Additional topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 18 cc. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. The tracheal mucosa was boggy and edematous. There were thick purulent secretions noted throughout the airways. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and sub-segment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and mucosa was boggy and erythematous as seen in the trachea with thick purulent secretions throughout the airway. Bronchial lavage of the lower lobe secretions was obtained (20cc in 10cc out). There were no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem and each segment and sub-segment in the left upper lobe, lingula and lower lobe was visualized. The left sided airway anatomy was normal and mucosa was boggy and erythematous as seen in the other airways with thick purulent secretions throughout the airway. The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with instillation of 90 cc of saline and return of 40 cc of lavage fluid. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn from the wedged position and after removing from trap remaining secretions were suctioned clear. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications.
Findings:
Diffusely edematous and erythematous airways with copious thick secretions.
No endobronchial lesions visualized

Recommendations:
Will await culture, cytology and cell count from lavage
Will initiate mucous clearance regiment with 3% saline neb TID, Flutter valve

"INDICATIONS: Completed stent trial
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 13 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sublottic glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient’s uncovered Ultraflex SEM stents in the trachea and bilateral main stems were widely patent with minimal intraluminal mucous. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optic was reinserted alongside rigid alligator forceps. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed the 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope and advanced to the distal trachea at which point the left and right main stem stents were also removed in a similar fashion, flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection.  There was moderate inflammation with slight granulation issue in the mucosa surrounding the previous stents with slow oozing of blood most predominantly in the distal trachea and main stem bronchi. There was also marked residual malacia which required conversion from open jet ventilation to closed conventional ventilation to main stem airway patency. The areas of active oozing were then treated with APC painting of the mucosa until sufficient hemostasis was achieved. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
Transfer to PACU
Discharge patient once criteria is met

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the ET tube into the tracheobronchial tree.   Tracheomalacia was noted in the trachea. The carina was sharp. The right-sided airway anatomy was normal. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L  (5.4mm) and 4R (5.5mm) lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by 4R lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE showed non-diagnostic tissue in the low probability 11L lymph node and benign lymphocytes in the 4Rs. All samples were sent for routine cytology. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

Medications: General Anesthesia
Topical: 80mg of lidocaine (8cc of 1%)
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords were normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Left sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions. The right mainstem, right upper lobe and proximal 80% of the bronchus intermedius was normal caliber without endobronchial lesions or mucosal irregularities. Mild extrinsic compression was present in the distal 20% of the bronchus intermedius. There was submucosal infiltration in the right middle lobe take off however it was widely patent. In the right lower lobe bronchus (just past the middle lobe take off) there was approximately 75% airway obstruction from a combination of submucosal infiltration and extrinsic tumor compression. The superior segment of the right lower lobe was 100% occluded. The bronchoscope was advanced past the obstruction which was about 1.5 cm in length and the basilar segments appeared uninvolved and were widely patent. 
The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L( 5.7mm), 7( 7.8mm) , !!rs (12.5 mm)  and 11Ri lymph nodes. The 11Ri lymph node was continuous with the primary tumor and involved by direct extension. The lymph node/mass was measured at 28.0 mm on ultrasonography. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node and finally the 11Ri/mass. The 11Rs was not sampled as this would not affect stage given the 11Ri involvement.  A total of 5 biopsies were performed in the 11L and 7 lymph node stations. Rapid on-site assessment of the station 11L was non-diagnostic (however low probability node so further sampling was not performed), and station 7 was normal lymphocytes. The 11Ri/mass was malignant favoring squamous cell carcinoma based on ROSE. A total of 9 needle passes were performed to ensure adequate material for PD L-1 and next generation sequencing with the majority of passes placed directly into cell block.  All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc

"Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia, 1% Lidocaine, tracheobronchial tree 14 mL. 
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. A brown plaque of unclear significance was seen on the epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R and station 11Rs lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4r Lymph node, followed by 11Rs using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
- Plan for CT guided biopsy of RLL lesion on 6/20/17
- Will refer to ENT for evaluation of mucosal plaque seen on epiglottis. ","{

"Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords were normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the right upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.  After adequate samples were obtained, the video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L, 7, 4R lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node and finally the 4R lymph node. A total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with RUL and endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results","{

Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc

Post Procedure Diagnosis:

"Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced via endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The large guide sheath catheter was then inserted through the working channel and the scope was advanced into the area of known pulmonary nodule within the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The radial ultrasound was inserted through the guide sheath and the guide sheath was advanced into the segment of interest. Location was confirmed by radial probe with a concentric view of the lesion. The radial probe was removed and under fluoroscopic guidance a total of 6 TBNAs were obtained. ROSE confirmed the presence of malignancy. Biopsies were then performed with the radial jaw 4 forceps under fluoroscopic visualization. Small bleeding did occur and resolved after wedging the bronchoscope within the segment for 2 minutes. After adequate samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no evidence of continued bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed
Complications: No immediate complications
Recommendations:
Transfer to PACU the SDS
CXR to r/o PTX
Discharge once criteria met
Await final pathology.

"Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R, 4L, Station 5 and 11L lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 4R Lymph node, followed by the 4L. The 4R yielded benign lymphocytes on ROSE evaluation while the 4L was non-diagnostic.  Given that the station 11L would only stage the patient as N1 disease and the station 5 lymph nodes, which were highly suspicious for malignancy based on FDG avidity and ultrasound characteristics, after careful consideration we decided to attempt biopsy via the trans-vascular route thorough the pulmonary artery a total of 7 passes were performed, Five biopsies were performed with the Boston Scientific 25 gauge EBUS needle and an additional two with Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE was consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications

"Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R,7, 11Rs, 11Ri lymph nodes. Additionally, the 10R lymph node, although 4mm, meets sampling criteria based on PET avidity.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4R Lymph node, followed by 7, 10R,11Rs,11Ri lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE showed benign lymphocytes in all stations. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the P190 Olympus video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and utilizing the radial EUBS probe we attempted to identify the left upper lobe lesion suspicious for malignancy but were unsuccessful. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- Unsuccessful localization of left upper lobe pulmonary nodule
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

"Indications: Hilar adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy 
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. There were thick greenish mucus plugs throughout the lungs which were easily suctioned. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The scope was advanced into the proximal left upper lobe and a 10mm hypoechoic structure was seen in the area of the 10L lymph node. Within the hypoechoic structure were hyperechoic bands similar to those seen in loculated pleural effusions. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needle and serous appearing liquid was noted within the suction line and attached syringe (approximately 2cc) consistent with cyst.  Subsequent pass with an Olympus 19G EBUS-TBNA needle yielded similar results with another 3cc fluid return. Ultrasound showed shrinkage of the cyst. Three additional needle passes were then performed. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed lymphocytes within the samples. Samples and fluid were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Post-operative diagnosis: Hilar cyst (bronchogenic vs cardiac)
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Recommendations:
- Transferred patient to post-procedural monitoring unit and discharge when standard criteria are met.
- 5 day course of Augmentin to reduce likelihood of infection of residual cystic space. 
- Will await final pathology results

"Indications: Left lower lobe nodule
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the 7.5 ETT. The airways were friable and significant blood was present from difficult intubation.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just distal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we were able to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the anterior-medial segment on the left lower lobe and navigated to within 1cm of the lesion. The navigational probe was then removed and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded a concentric view affirming the location.  Needle biopsies were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE was non-diagnostic. The catheter was repositioned to sample other areas of the lesion and radial probe continued to show a concentric view of the tumor. ROSE again was read as non-diagnostic. Tissue biopsies were then performed using forceps under fluoroscopic visualization along with brush and triple needle brush biopsies. After samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the diagnostic bronchoscope was re-inserted into the airway. Subsequent inspection did not show evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed from the airway. 
Following completion of the procedure the patient was noted to lack audible airleak when the ETT balloon was deflated. Given the difficult intubation, anesthesia decided to leave patient intubated and transfer to the ICU to monitor and extubate when deemed appropriate. 
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule
- Will transfer to the ICU and attempt extubation later today. 
- Await final pathology

A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 90 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.

"Indications: Left upper lobe mass 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Ri (5.0 mm), and 11Rs(6.6 mm). Additionally the 4L was 4.9 mm but slightly hypoechoic and decision was made to sample this node as well. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot 2 EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180  degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful and biopsy of left upper nodule
- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation 
- Await final pathology  
- Post-procedure xray did not show pneumothorax. 
- Patient was noted to be slightly hypoxic post-procedure likely as a result of sedation and decision was made to admit patient for overnight observation.

"Indications: Left upper lobe mass 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. Endobronchial brushing was performed at the takeoff of the right upper lobe followed by endobronchial biopsies within the right upper, right middle and left upper lobe for research purposes as per standard DECAMP protocol.  The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Rs and station 711L lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the attached EBUS procedural sheet. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 45 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound failed to confirm location on multiple attempts and we subsequently removed the ENB catheter and were able to locate the lesion based on anatomical knowledge with the white light bronchoscope and confirm target with radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization followed by BAL of the segment.  ROSE showed malignancy within the target lesion in the left upper lobe.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful and biopsy of left upper lobe mass with malignancy identified on primary evaluation. 
- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation 
- Await final pathology

Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot  EBUSTBNA 19 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then tried to visualize the FDG avid station 5 lymph node seen on PET CT through the pulmonary artery but were unable to clearly visualize the node and thus could not sample from the mainstem approach (transvascular). We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy. At this point the patient had lost her IV access and developed laryngospasm prompting us to bronchoscopically intubate the patient with a size 8.5 ETT which was easily passed through the vocal cords and into the lower trachea before being secured in place. The Q190 bronchscope was then advanced, using anatomical knowledge,  into the proximal left upper lobe adjacent to the station 5 lymph node and utilizing radial EBUS attempted to sample this node through an airway approach with a transbronchial needle approach. ROSE was unrevealing and we subsequently the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement was attempted once we were in the vicinity of the point of interest with radial ultrasound. The lesion however could not be adequately visualized. Multiple attempts to navigate to the lesion were unfruitful and we subsequently completed the procedure without attempting to sample the left upper lobe peripheral lesion. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation

"Indications: lung cancer diagnosis and staging (left upper lobe tumor)
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, except for in the left lower lobe in which the proximal origin was mildly extrinsically compressed.  The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Rs (6.7mm), 10R (5.7mm), 4R (9.1mm), 2R (7.1 mm), 7 (15.7mm), 4L (6.9mm),  and 11L (21.1mm)  lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11Rs Lymph node followed by 7, and 4R, 2R lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE showed malignant cells in the 4R and 2R station consistent with N3 disease. We then moved to the large 11L lymph node and took 8 additional passes for molecular studies. All samples were sent for routine cytology and a dedicated pass from the 11L was sent for flow cytometry. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.

Post Procedure Recommendations:
- Transfer to post-procedure unit and home per protocol
- Will await final pathology results

"Indications: Lung mass
Medications: General Anesthesia
Consent was obtained from the patient’s father prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
The patient had been previously intubated for proceeding procedure. The UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, into the esophagus. Using the vascular anatomy the bronchoscope was directed to the area of the known paraesophageal mass abutting the aorta just below the left atrium.  The mass was well-visualized with ultrasound directly behind the aorta with a small window which the needle could be passed between the left atrium and aorta. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUS TBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation was non-diagnostic after multiple attempts.  We then removed the EBUS bronchoscope. The endotracheal tube was removed and a size I-Gel LMA was inserted. The P190 thin video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Within a subsegment of the posterior basal branch of the left lower lobe and normal-appearing endobronchial mucus was seen overlying the orifice. The radial EBUS probe was inserted into the segment and a concentric lesional view was obtained. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include needle forceps and brush. A BAL was then performed in the segment. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. Samples were sent for cytology and culture. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful EUS-B biopsy and radial probe biopsy of lung mass 
- Will await final pathology and culture results","{

"Indications: Lung mass, suspicious for malignancy
Medications: General Anesthesia, 1% Lidocaine, tracheobronchial tree 14 mL. 
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11Rs lymph node.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE was showed benign lymphocytes. Subsequently the EBUs bronchoscope was removed and the therapeutic Q180 video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway. A guide sheet was inserted into the superior segment of the right lower lobe under fluoroscopic visualization and radial EBUS was advanced through the guide sheet to visualize the known lung mass. The radial probe was removed and peripheral TBNA needle was inserted through the guide sheath under fluoroscopic visualization to sample the right lower lobe mass. A total of 5 needle biopsies were obtained. Preliminary ROSE did not show malignancy but abundant inflammatory cells were seen suspicious for lung abscess.  Using fluoroscopy we then performed a total of 6 forceps guided biopsies through the guide sheath for tissue evaluation and culture followed by mini-lavage in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
- Will empirically start on Augmentin for treatment of suspected lung abscess.

"Indications: Malignant Pleural Effusion requiring additional tissue for molecular analysis
Medications: Fentanyl 150 mcg, Midazolam 3 mg, Lidocaine (topical) 300 mg
Procedural Details:
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position, and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by ultrasound in the left 8th rib space. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.
An 18-gauge, 5 cm long echogenic percutaneous entry needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space, and fluid was aspirated to verify placement. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the needle, and the needle was then withdrawn. A 1.5 cm incision was made through the skin, and a 14 Fr dilator was advanced into the pleural space over the wire.
The dilator was removed, and gentle dissection with Kelly forceps was performed alongside the wire until the pleural space was entered. A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 8th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid, resulting in the removal of approximately 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.
The pleura had diffuse carcinomatosis, and thick adhesions were present with tethering of the lung to the chest wall. The 5 mm port was removed, and an 8 mm port was inserted in the same fashion through the original entry point. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture, with approximately five total biopsies taken. There was mild bleeding associated with the biopsies. An additional 375 cc of sanguineous fluid was then removed with suction applied through the port. Repeat examination of the pleural space showed residual bleeding had subsided.
The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the port, and the port was withdrawn. A 14 Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain and pigtail straightening obturator were inserted into the pleural space over the wire. The obturator and wire were removed, and the drain was then immediately connected to a Pleur-Evac via the connecting tubing adapter. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and tidaling. The incision was then sutured into place with subcuticular 0 silk suture. Once the air leak had subsided, a chest X-ray was performed, which showed lung re-expansion. The chest tube was then removed, and the site was dressed with Steri-Strips, gauze, and Tegaderm.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed lung re-expansion and minimal residual effusion.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 20 cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion
Specimens:
•	Pleural fluid- 1275 cc (sent for cytology and microbiological analysis)
•	Pleural biopsies- 5 (sent for pathology and culture)
Recommendation:
•	Await pathology and microbiological studies.
•	Suture removal in 2 weeks.

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy and lung mass
Procedure Performed: EBUS bronchoscopy single station.
Pre-operative diagnosis: Lung mass 
Post-operative diagnosis: malignant mediastinal adenopathy, new onset A. fib 
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. Blood was seen within the right main-stem and gently suctioned. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Obvious sub-mucosal infiltration of tumor was seen through the bronchus intermedius extending into the right middle lobe. The right upper lobe was obstructed from combination extrinsic compression and sub-mucosal infiltration. Blood was seen slowly oozing from the right upper lobe. The right lower lobe bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions. The left sided airways had normal bronchial mucosa and anatomy; without endobronchial lesions.   The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the 4R lymph node which was a conglomerate of nodes extending into the station 10R . Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed  with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Near the end of the procedure the patient became significantly tachycardic and hypotensive with new onset A. fib with RVR.  The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and the Q190 video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. Cardiology was called to the bedside and decision was made for bedside cardioversion which was successful in terminating the rhythm for a short period however she subsequently returned to atrial flutter but with a more controlled rate.  After awakening the patient had difficulty with oxygen saturation for a few minutes and we reintroduced the bronchoscope through the nasal passage to evaluate for evidence of of active bleeding within the airway, none was seen.  The patient was then transferred to the ICU for observation status post cardioversion in good condition.

Complications: Intraoperative atrial fibrillation with RVR
Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
-New onset atrial fibrillation
Recommendations
- Will await final pathology results
- We’ll discuss with radiation oncology early treatment to right upper lobe given active hemoptysis.","{

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy in setting of known lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Left proximal left mainstem was normal. There was submucosal tumor infiltration in the distal 3 cm of the left mainstem circumferentially. The left lower lobe was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor. The left upper lobe orifice was approximately 70% obstructed with tumor and the LC1 carina was infiltrated with tumor. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7, 4L lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 7 Lymph node, followed by the 4L lymph node. ROSE evaluation yielded benign lymphocytes in the station 7 and scant lymphocytes in station 4L. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.
Decision was made to not proceed with mediastinoscopy as the left mainstem and upper lobe disease would preclude previously considered surgical resection and treatment would not be effected by the presence of N2 disease. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
- Will present at tumor board for consideration of chemo-rads

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy in setting of testicular cancer s/p chemotherapy
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes. The Station 7 was 16.6 mm, the station 4R was 5.7mm and the station 11Rs was 8.9mm.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the station 7 Lymph node, followed by station 11Rs lymph node and then the 4R lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. A total of 5 needle passes were performed at each lymph node station. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. There was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post-operative diagnosis: Mediastinal  adenopathy 
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The distal right trachea was partially externally compressed and the right mainstem at the orifice was significantly externally compressed (85%) which opened up to normal in the distal right mainstem. The left mainstem and takeoff were normal. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and moderate thick secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station paratracheal mediastinal mass (level of 4R lymph node). The mass measured in short axis at 4.8 cm. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 19 gauge Visioshot-2 needle with a total of 6 needle passes. Rapid onsite evaluation read as suspicious for lymphoma. All samples were sent for routine cytology or flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 3 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

"Indications: Mediastinal Adenopathy with concern for brain mets
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. There was partial dynamic obstruction of the trachea of unclear etiology.  The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.  Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes were seen in multiple stations in relatively symmetric pattern. Mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed by transbronchial needle aspiration with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node followed by the 4L lymph node and finally the 2R lymph node.  A total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station (station 2R 7 samples were collected). ROSE evaluation yielded multiple granulomas from the 11L, 4L and 2R stations and adequate lymphocytes from station 7. All samples were sent for routine cytology and two additional samples were taken for AFB and fungal culture from the station 2R. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood there and secretions there was some slow oozing seen in the bilateral lower lobes. 2ml of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine were instilled into each lower lobe and the bleeding stopped. Once we were confident that there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10ml

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results","{

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Just distal to the cricoid cartilage the suspicious 2L lymph node was identified Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with both the Olympus 19G and Olympus 22G needles with a total of 8 passes performed. Abundant lymphocytes were seen in rapid onsite pathological evaluation. Samples were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 4R, lymph node was identified and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 19G Visioshot EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Initial rapid onsite evaluation showed scattered lymphocytes but no evidence of malignancy or granuloma. We then placed the Olympus mini-forceps through the working channel of the EBUS scope and adnaved the forceps through a tract in the airway created by the EBUS needle. We were able to visualize the forceps using the EBUS ultrasound within the lymph node. We then closed and retracted the forceps. This was performed twice and touchpreps were made with the collected specimins which showed abundant non-caseating granulomas on rapid onsite pathological evaluation. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle and mini-forceps.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 7, lymph node was identified and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed malignancy. Samples were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and DECAMP research bronchoscopy was performed with endobronchial forceps biopsy of the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and left upper lobe as well as endobronchial brushing of bronchus intermedius. After suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies and DECAMP research protocol. 
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

"Indications: Mediastinal staging and primary diagnosis of suspected lung malignancy
Medications: General Anesthesia, 1% Lidocaine, tracheobronchial tree 12 mL 
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  Bronchial stumps from previous right upper and right middle lobe resections were intact. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was not met in any of the accessible lymph node stations. The EBUS bronchoscope was then advanced into the right lower lobe and a 11.4mm hypoechoic nodule was visualized with ultrasound. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle with a total of 9 needle passes. Preliminary ROSE indicated malignancy. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the attached EBUS procedural sheet. All samples were sent for routine cytology. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post procedure monitoring unit. ","{

"Indications: Migratory lung nodules
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, there were thick non-purulent sections in multiple airways which were suctioned.  Following inspection a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180cc instillation and 70cc return. The super-dimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest.  Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen.  Subsequently further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation.  After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

"Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L, station 7, 10R 11Rs lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning at the N3 (11L) lymph nodes 711Rs10R. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the attached EBUS procedural sheet. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path eval did not identify malignancy. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the right middle lobe to the area of known nodule using radial EBUS confirmed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. While emerging from anesthesia patient had large volume emesis and possible aspiration event. He was immediately placed on right side. He transiently became hypoxic but saturations improved relatively quickly. Patinet was then transferred to the PACU. X-ray was performed which right greater than left patchy opacities with increased pulmonary vasculature and interstitial markings alone with a small right apical pneumothorax. Right sided airspace opacities, although possibly representing aspiration event, are more likely related to retained saline instilled during bronchoscopy and is not unexpected. Patient was informed of pneumothorax. He was hemodynamically stable and oxygenating well. Repeat CXR 1 hour later showed no expansion of pneumothorax and decision was made to observe for expansion and not place chest tube unless he develops symptoms or has expansion of pneumothorax.

Complications: 
1.	Small left apical pneumothorax
2.	Post procedure emesis with possible aspiration  
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.
Recommendations:
- Admit to IM for overnight observation
- Repeat CXR in 4 hours and then AM if not changes
- Consider diuresis given pulmonary edema and Systolic heart failure
- Continue to hold Plavix for now.
- Would NOT treat with antibiotics 
- Await final pathology

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of fish mouth dynamic obstruction of the right middle lobe. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe were endobronchial tumor was visualized.  The radial EBUS probe was inserted through the bronchoscope and advanced into the airway and an eccentric view of the lesion was identified. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. ROSE identified malignancy. After adequate samples were obtained, the video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 4R and 11Rs. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation showed adequate lymphocytes in the 4R lymph node and were non-diagnostic in the 11Rs. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted again into the airway and 5 more forceps biopsies were obtained in the apical segment of the right upper lobe for cell block and molecular analysis. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Q190 re-inserted into the airways. DECAMP research samples were then performed with brushing within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies in the RUL, RML and LUL. We then observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Onsite path evaluation did not identify malignancy. The bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe and a large sheeth catheter with radial ultrasoung to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush with fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the Q190 re-inserted into the airways. To remove secretions and blood and once confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

"Indications: Pulmonary Nodule
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. Tracheomalacia was noted as we advanced the scope to the carina. The carina was sharp. The right and left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  We then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the EBUS bronchoscope into the airway. We attempted to visualize the nodule with endobronchial ultrasound but did not see the nodule with ultrasound. We then inserted the therapeutic bronchoscope for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy.  We were not able to get to the nodule using the navigation equipment.  After suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Complications: None.
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.  No specimens were obtained for path review.

"Indications: Pulmonary Nodule
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just distal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  We then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the P190 slim bronchoscope into the airway. We attempted to visualize endobronchial disease within the anterior basilar segment of the left lower lobe but could not advance the scope distally enough. We then inserted the radial ultrasound through the working channel of the bronchoscope and an eccentric view of the kno0wn nodule was obtained. We then performed peripheral TBNAs of the point of interest. ROSE did not show obvious malignancy. At this point we removed the slim scope and inserted the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope through the mouth, and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. We attempted to wedge the scope in the lower lobe to potentially visualize the tumor with ultrasound. We saw an unusual area of soft tissue which did not obviously look like would be expected from the nodule. Two biopsies were performed using the 22G EBUS-TBNA needle. ROSE however showed only blood. Finally, fluoroscopy was brought into the room and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left lower lobe and a large sheath catheter with radial ultrasound to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush with fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.  After suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.
Following completion of the procedure the patient was noted to have audible upper airway sounds and ventilation was difficult.  And decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. Initially this was attempted over the bronchoscope however edema within the structures of the middle laryngeal cavity (above the vocal cords this was unsuccessful. Anesthesia was then able to intubate with the glideslope. The bronchoscope was then inserted through the ETT to confirm positioning 2cm above the carina and to suction secretions. The patient was then transferred to the ICU. 

Complications: Unexpected admission
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule
- Will transfer to the ICU and attempt extubation later today. 
- Await final pathology  ","{

"Indications: right lower lobe nodule 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. A polyp wasseen on the left vocal cord. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the right lower lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful navigational biopsy of right lower lobe nodule.  
-Vocal Cord polyp

"Indications: Right upper lobe nodule 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the right upper lobe to the area of known nodule and an eccentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy and unable to clearly identify that adequate sampling was performed.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful peripheral radial probe guided eccentric localization 
- Will await final pathology results ","{

"Indications: staging of bilateral lung cancer (metastatic vs synchronous primary)
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4LR,7, and 4R lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4L Lymph node followed by 7, and 4R lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. The 4L lymph node was extremely difficult to access due to angle of left mainstem and after one biopsy no further attempts performed. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE showed non-diagnostic tissue in the 4L and 4R lymph nodes and benign lymphocytes in the station 7 lymph node. All samples were sent for routine cytology. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.

"INDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the endotracheal tube was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. Due to hypoxia and difficulty obtaining sufficient chest wall expansion the decision was made to convert to conventional ventilation. The rigid bronchsocpe was attached to the conventional ventilator adapter the mouth was packed and the side ports were closed to allow closed system ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the proximal bronchus intermedius a completely obstructive tumor with overlying blood clot was seen. The right upper lobe however was widely patent. Using cryotherapy probe we removed the overlying blood clot and were able to better visualize the obstructive tumor which originated at the medial aspect of the BI with a wide based stock. A small opening was seen at the lateral aspect but was too small to visualize and open airways distally. Due to high oxygen requirements and persistent hypoxemia we were unable to utilize thermal therapies for debulking.  We thus advanced to the rigid bronchoscope into the proximal bronchus intermedius and using the beveled tip attempted to apple core the proximal edge of the lesion which allowed for us to then cryo-debulk the lesion with a lower risk of developing an area repair.  Two large pieces of tumor were successfully removed with carotid debulking and we were then able to advance the bronchoscope passed the obstruction into the distal bronchus intermedius where we could visualize the right middle lobe and the orifice of the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe.  Extensive purulent material consistent with postobstructive pneumonia was seen and suctioned into a trap to be sent for culture.  At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 20mm x 10mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the bronchus intermedius allowing aeration of the right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, and the distal airways to include the right middle and right lower lobe including the superior segment.  Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was re-intubated fiber-optically without difficulty

"POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Resolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem
INDICATIONS: extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. The left vocal cord was noted to be fixed consistent with vocal cord paralysis. Muscle relaxants were then given and we then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Airway inspection was performed and there were thick purulent secretions throughout the airways which were suctioned. In the mid to distal trachea there was approximately 30-40% obstruction from posterior extrinsic compression. The right mainstem was approximately 15% obstructed at the proximal orifice and opened up to be widely patent distally.  The right-sided airways were free of endobronchial disease in the mucosa was normal.  On the left there was significant airway obstruction beginning at the orifice of the left mainstem with friable erythematous mucosa causing approximately 40% obstruction however in the mid left mainstem there is significant protrusion of extrinsic mass with likely some degree of submucosal infiltration resulting in about 90-95% airway obstruction.  The therapeutic bronchoscope could not pass the lesion.  We then attempted to pass lesion with the diagnostic Q 190 bronchoscope and were also unsuccessful. We then again attempted to pass lesion with the ultrasound P190 bronchoscope which was successfully able to bypass lesion.  Approximately 5 mm proximal to the LC2 carina the airways open to near normal luminal diameter.  There were thick postobstructive secretions at all left-sided airways which were suctioned. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed along with the LMA and a 10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. There is a significant week which impaired ability to ventilate and multiple attempts at packing the mouth were unsuccessful.  The 10 mm rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13 mm non-ventilating tracheoscope was introduced in the airway in a similar fashion with the hope that this would eliminate/reduce the ventilator leak however similar issues arose and we subsequently decided to remove the rigid bronchoscope and perform the procedure through a 8.5 ET tube which was placed by anesthesia.  There was some hypoxia for a few minutes mostly in the mid 80s but for a short period time in the upper 70s which was likely related to the recruitment from the time period of inadequate ventilation which eventually resolved allowing us to continue with the procedure. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed however slightly too distally and was retracted into proper position with forceps. Balloon dilatation was then performed of the stent which only partially open due to significant external compression using a 10/11/12 CRE balloon which expanded the stent with only mild deformity with a subsequent diameter of the left mainstem approximately 80% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. 
Recommendations:
-	Transfer back to ward
-	Post-procedure x-ray
-	Start 3% saline nebs 3cc combined with 2cc albuterol 3 times daily for stent maintenance. 
-	Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified 
-	Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge. ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right lower lobe segmental obstruction 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.	Mucous plugging, with diffuse tracheobronchitis. 
2.	Mild Trachobronchiomlalacia 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  flexible bronchoscopy with bronchial washing
CONSCIOUS SEDATION:
1.  Fentanyl 100 mg IV push.
2.  Versed 4 mg IV push.

TOPICAL ANESTHESIA:  29 cc 1% lidocaine 

SPECIMENS SENT:

1.  Bronchial washing sent for cytology and culture
FINDINGS:  
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, all risks and benefits were explained to him.  The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite and administered local anesthesia to the left naris and posterior pharynx.  This was then followed by administration of conscious sedation. The Olympus Q190 bronchoscope was then inserted through the left nare into the posterior oropharynx.   The vocal cords appeared to move normally during pronation. The bronchoscope was then passed into the trachea. Tthere appeared to be mild tracheomalacia as well as diffuse tracheobronchitis with boggy erythematous mucous extending throughout the right and left bronchial trees with thick yellow mucous seen throughout the airways. After suctioning of mucous plugs inspection was performed to at least the first subsegmental bronchi on all left and right sided airways. No endobronchial lesions were identified. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the right lower lobe and the bronchoscope was wedged into the lateral segment.  Bronchoalveolar lavage was then performed at this segment utilizing 90 mL of saline. The wedge was lost due to coughing and suction was reapplied yielding a bronchial wash rather than a true BAL. When this was completed, the airways were again inspected and no evidence of hemorrhage was seen.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

 Recommendations:
1.	Await cytology and culture results.
2.	Repeat CT chest in 1 month to ensure resolution of radiographic findings.

Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   
Complications:  Extension of TE fistula 
Recommendations:
-	Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.
-	Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU
-	Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible 
-	Appreciate GI recommendations. 
-	Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware
-	Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
-	If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.
-	Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).
-	Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.
-	If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.	","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	Flexible bronchoscopy

INDICATIONS: Dyspnea and hypoxia 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Once the patient was sedated and neuromuscularly relaxed a left sided double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted into the airway.  Confirmation of placement was performed bronchoscopically and subsequently a catheter was connected to the bronchial port while single lung ventilation was performed through the tracheal port and submerged in saline to evaluate for any evidence of air leaking to the contralateral side and none was witnessed.  At this point the patient was placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position and we began by instilling 1 L of warm saline into the left-sided bronchial port of the double-lumen tube.  Following installation chest percussion was performed for approximately 4 minutes at which time the patients bed was repositioned in the Trendelenburg position and gravity dependent drainage of the fluid began.  Initial fluid cloudy with a significant sediment as expected and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  This process was repeated multiple times, after approximately 3 L of instillation and 2200cc of drainage low suction was attached intermittently through the drainage port to assist with fluid removal.  We continue to perform lavages to maintain a maximal post installation positive balance of no more than 1200 cc to prevent barotrauma and possible pneumothorax.  After approximately 8 L of insulation and 7200 cc of return the fluid had cleared to the point where there was only a minimal cloudiness and no evidence of active sedimentation indicating that the procedure was successful and no further lavage was necessary.  At this point the case was turned over to anesthesia for immersion and extubation.  Post extubation the patient was hypoxic to the high 80s on noninvasive ventilation as well as extremely combative and decision was made to watch the patient in the ICU rather than the ward overnight.

Complications: none
Recommendations:
-	Transferred to the ICU for overnight observation
-	Obtain chest x-ray now and in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax
-	The patient does well overnight located discharge tomorrow
-	Plan for right-sided lavage in approximately 2 weeks","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Resolving Mediastinal Mass 
2.	Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Resolving Mediastinal Mass  status post tracheal Y-stent removal
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with  Tracheal stent removal
2.	Cryotherapy for debulking of granulation tissue
INDICATIONS:  resolution of airway compression 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was no granulation tissue visualized at the proximal tracheal tip which was 2cm distal to the vocal cords. Moderate thick mucus was seen throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb was normal without granulation tissue. At the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 30% obstruction.  At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. The rigid optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal but due to some minor bleeding it was difficult to visualize adequately and the rigid optics were removed. Flexible bronchoscope was then inserted into the rigid tracheoscope to remove secretions. The non-optical rigid forceps were then inserted alongside the rigid optic and the stent was grasped and then were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent and rigid bronchoscope were subsequently removed without difficulty. The stent was fully intact.  Once his stent was removed the LMA was reinserted and the the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted. The 1.9mm flexible cryoprobe was inserted through the working channel and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue in the mid left mainstem with 30 second freeze thaw times and at least 3 activations per site. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia 
2.	Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia  status post tracheal Y-stent removal
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with  Tracheal stent removal
2.	Cryotherapy to granulation tissue
INDICATIONS:  Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty and was fully intact.  Once his stent was removed the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection. There was significant (near complete dynamic airway collapse of the trachea and mainstem bronchi as expected given known TBM.  The 1.9mm flexible cryoprobe was inserted through the working channel and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue with 30 second freeze thaw times and at least 3 activations per site. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Complications: None
Recommendations:
- Transfer back to PACU and then to wards
-  Plan for stent holiday to allow healing of granulation tissue and based on symptoms possible replacement of the stent sometime in the future.  ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	Flexible bronchoscopy, diagnostic
INDICATIONS:  Airway stent evaluation
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: Moderate
Total sedation medications: Versed 3mg, Fentanyl 75 mcg
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the nose, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. Topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. 
The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. During the procedure, the patient did develop some intermittent hypoxia, requiring attachment of the oxygen supply to the bronchoscope working channel for direct tracheal oxygen administration which resolved the hypoxia. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.
Complications: None
Recommendations:
-RTC 03 Jan 2020 at 1000 with Dr. Trentacosta
-Plan for stent removal for 'holiday' in MOR 06 Jan 2020 or earlier if symptoms require
-continue TID nebulized hypertonic saline
-hold vest physiotherapy
- The risks and benefits of the procedure to include bleeding, vocal cord injury hypoxia, airway injury and death were all discussed with the patient who had appropriate mental capacity and understanding of the procedure and he wishes to proceed.","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia  status post tracheal Y-stent placement
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with  Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement
2.	Rigid bronchoscopy with  Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement removal
3.	Dumon Tracheal Y-stent insertion
INDICATIONS: Chronic symptoms (cough, dyspnea, pneumonia) of severe tracheobronchomalacia
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the Q190 flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 4 cm proximal to the main carina there was near complete expiratory collapse of the airway which extended into the bilateral mainstem bronchi and bronchus intermedius. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa was boggy throughout, with the exception of the severe dynamic collapse anatomy were otherwise normal with no endobronchial lesions seen to at least the first sub-segments. There was thick purulent secretions within the bilateral lower lobes (likely secondary to chronic post-obstructive pneumonia from severe airway collapse) which were suctioned.  Measurements of the collapsible central airways were obtained. We then removed the LMA. A MAC 3 video laryngoscope (C-MAC) was then used to expose the larynx with a grade 1 view obtained. The customized 15x12x12 Dynamic Y-stent with a tracheal length of 80mm, right mainstem limb of 10mm and left mainstem limb which was collapsed and secured with Freitag forceps was then passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The forceps were opened and once resistance was met indicating the stent had reached the main carina the forceps were removed. Subsequently a 12mm rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope was inserted into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid tracheoscope and the stent required minimal adjustment to seat in the desired location. Once this was completed the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 
Patient was recovering without issues in the PACU and post-procedure chest x-ray was performed which showed some proximal stent migration and the right sided limb appeared to be of inadequate length to ensure stability. CT was then performed which confirmed the inadequate length f the right sided limb. The patient was then subsequently taken back to the operating room where after induction and administration of paralytics a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilation. Using optical forceps we attempted to remove the original Y-stent however the size of the tracheoscope was inadequate and we converted to a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope which allowed us to easily removed the stent with optical forceps. After-resizing the airways an 18x14x14 Dumon tracheal Y-stent was customized to a tracheal length of 80mm right mainstem length of 30mm and left mainstem limb of 40mm. The stent was then loaded into the Novatech Ton stent deployment device.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of flexible forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed a flexible bronchoscopic inspection to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway collapse. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Complications: Return to OR for stent revision
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU and then to wards
-  Obtain post procedure CXR
- Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
- Critical airway posting at bedside. 
- If Oxygen therapy is required, the oxygen should preferentially be humidified to prevent secretions from become increasingly thick and tenacious.
- Standard pulmonary toilette (IS, ambulation ect) is appropriate. 
- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation is contraindicated as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.
- If clinical visualization of the stent is require, CT scan or bronchoscopy is needed.","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Small Cell Lung Cancer with Central Airway Obstruction 
2.	Retained/Embedded Metallic airway stent 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1.	Small Cell Lung Cancer with Central Airway Obstruction s/p airway stent removal and Y-stent insertion
1.	INDICATIONS: 1. Malignant Central Airway Obstruction 2. Retained/Embedded Metallic airway stent 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure the patient could be adequately ventilation. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid trachea was free of tumor but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM).  The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway causing approximately 70% obstruction. There were a few small tumor nodules present in the distal trachea mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucous throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive puss was noted distal to the stent primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus and mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe however appeared free of disease. 
At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus and was then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge to the stent. APC was used followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We the utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and then gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided in a similar fashion outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. Open which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compressor however was still present. At this point we took our attention to the right sided airway and utilizing APC with the burn and shave technique attempting to re-cannulate the airway with partial success however obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. 
Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb and 35 mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius.   The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right  mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. 
Recommendations:
- Transfer PACU
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation given residual disease. 
Patient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.
- Management of stent related complications were discussed with the in-patient team and a notice for airway management precautions placed above the patients bed. 
- Stent will need to be removed prior to traveling back to Hawaii as removal requires rigid bronchoscopy. Plan to schedule for procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after effects of radiation should be seen). ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without and endoluminal obstruction. On the right there was minimal structuring of the BI . On the left the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded. Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation however due to the proximal obstruction dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a jagwire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we performed APC to the left maintem followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly re-opened but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets however once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture. At this point to protect from major vascular bleeding we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax and in the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition. 
Recommendations:
-	Patient to remain intubated tonight 
-	CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung.
-	Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery.
-	Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention. 
-	If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight place left side down, intubate right main stem, ","{

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the operating room. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal appearing with minimal mild thick secretions. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and subsegment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem. In the distal mainstem there was circumferential erythema of the airway wall without stenosis. There was purulent secretions in the left upper and lower lobe. Bronchial wash was performed in the left upper lobe for culture.  The left upper lobe airways were not stenotic but had chronic erythematous appearance consistent with radiation changes. The left lower lobe take-off was not stenotic but there was moderate stenosis of the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe and severe stenosis (90%) of the anterior medial segment. No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left. Following inspection we removed the diagnostic bronchoscope and introduced the T180 therapeutic bronchoscope. Our attention to the stenosis within the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe and gentle dilatation was performed with the 6mm Elation dilating balloon with mild improvement in stenosis. The airway wall was friable however and oozed easily. We then attempted to gently dilate the anterior-medial segment by bypassing the obstruction and gently inflating the balloon to partial expansion (<6mm) and pull back through the stenosis. When this was done relatively brisk bleeding developed. We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed. At that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula s/p Ivor Lewis Esophagostomy 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula s/p Ivor Lewis Esophagostomy  s/p occlusive left mainstem stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible, self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula with persistent leak despite esophageal stent
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives a flexible bronchoscope was passed through the patients tracheostomy tube and into the airways. The trachea was normal. Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways. Once secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis. On the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall. Distally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy. Multiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.  At this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula. We then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction. This was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.
Post procedure diagnosis:
Recommendations:
- Transfer back to ICU
- Await tissue diagnosis from biopsied endobronchial nodules
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- TID saline nebulizers along with ensuring oxygen is humidified to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Complex Tracheal Stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Tracheal stenosis s/p stent placement.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with airway dilatation and stent insertion. 
INDICATIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the flexible bronchoscope was inserted into the posterior oropharynx via an LMA. The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection a long segment complex tracheal stenosis was visualized beginning approximately 3cm distal to the vocal cords and extending for just under 4cm in length.  The maximal obstruction was approximately 60% of normal airway in the mid to distal aspect of the stenosis. The distal trachea was normal. The right and left sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental airways and with the exception of some thick mucus in the left lower lobe which was easily suctioned there is no endobronchial lesions or irregular mucosa.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced just proximal to the tracheal stenosis and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and a 16 x 40 uncovered Ultraflex stent was advanced into the airway alongside a pediatric bronchoscope.  The stent was deployed with direct visualization.  There was slightly distal deployment and the stent was manipulated with both flexible and rigid forceps until it was adequately seated with the proximal and distal limb just beyond the stenosis.  Balloon dilatation was then performed with a 15/16.5/18 urination dilatation of balloon to a maximum diameter of 16.5 mm.  Post dilatation the airway was approximately 90% of normal diameter.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.  
Complications: None
Recommendations:
Patient to be transferred to the PACU
Discharge home once criteria met from postprocedural Ward 
Patient to follow-up with interventional pulmonology at date to be determined

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Endoluminal right mainstem obstruction secondary to presumed RCC.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tumor obstruction of the bronchus intermedius 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial dubulking
INDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of right mainstem with complete lung collapse  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right mainstem, protruding slightly into the supra-carinal space was a large mass causing complete obstruction. The lesion appeared to have a stock/base and we therefore secured the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare. The lesion was snared and immediately hemorrhaged briskly completely obscuring the field of view. The rigid bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem to attempt to isolate the bleeding however the patient’s oxygen saturation continued to fall and the decision was made to remove the rigid scope and insert an ETT. This was done by anesthesia using an 8.0 ETT. The patient was placed right side down to protect the left lung and while suctioning blood via a flexible bronchoscope in the ETT. Vision remained poor and we utilized topical TXA and epi to try to slow the bleeding while using cryotherapy probe to pull blood clots from the airways. Eventually the bleeding stopped and the patient’s oxygen saturation returned to normal. Once we were able to better visualize the airways we found that the left side had relatively mild blood spillover and at the LC1 carina the transected tumor was seen which was removed piecemeal using the cryotherapy probe.  Subsequently we began to debulk further into right lung. The right upper lobe was eventually visualized. We attempted to use APC to ""burn and shave"" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies. We were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained. Patient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date. Once this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina. The bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed. Decision in consultation with anesthesia was for patient to remain intubated for now and transfer to the ICU.
Specimens: Right mainstem tumor
Fluids/Blood Products:
IVF: 1500  EBL: 200cc  Blood Products: None
 Complications: Severe hemorrhage, severe hypoxia, Escalation in level of care.
Recommendations: 
-	Patient to remain intubated overnight, with endobronchial blocker at bedside.
-	If no bleeding overnight plan to extubate tomorrow.
-	Will need to discuss options moving forward. Given the extent of the tumor risk/benefit ratio of re-attempting debulking needs to be carefully considered along with alternative options such as radiotherapy. ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Endotracheal tumor 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking 
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.
Recommendations: 
•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy. ","{

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking 
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. The subglottic area and proximal trachea were normal. At the level of the med trachea there was a large polypoid tumor with a ball valve effect with the base at the left posterior tracheal wall. The tumor was about 90% obstructive of the normal tracheal diameter. Additionally there wer multiple small polypoid lesions surrounding the large obstructive mass mostly on the posterior wall of the trachea but also on the anterior and right tracheal wall. These findings extended for about 3cm. We did not attempt to pass the polypoid lesion with the bronchoscope during the initial inspection.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the obstructive mass at its base. We then inserted the 1.9mm cryotherapy probe through the flexible bronchoscope and attached the probe using cryotherapy to the resected tumor and attempted to extract it through the rigid bronchoscope. The tumor however was too large and repeatedly fell off of the cryoprobe when trying to pull it through the rigid scope. We then switched to the large 2.4mm cryoprobe and again using the same technique were able to pull pieces of the tumor out if a piecemeal fashion and residual pieces of the resected tumor were then extracted with flexible forceps. After the primary tumor was removed we then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 95% open in comparison to unaffected areas. We then were able to complete the distal airway inspection. The lower trachea, right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer with TR fistula and endobronchial invasion. 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, endobronchial biopsy, tumor debulking, and Silicone Y-stent placement
INDICATIONS: Extrinsic airway compression and suspected TE fistula.
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The right vocal cord was irregular appearing with small vocal cord nodule visualized.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal with the exception of some mild mucosal irregularity in distal 2cm of the posterior tracheal wall. Thick purulent material was seen pulling at the level of the carina and the proximal left mainstem. After clearing secretions a endobronchial mass which appeared to extend from the esophagus was visualized within the proximal left mainstem causing about 80% endobronchial obstruction.  Just proximal to that mass was a small area where GI contents could be seen entering the airway consistent with a small TE fistula.  This was only about 1-2 mm distal to the main carina.  After bypassing the main tumor within the proximal left mainstem which was about 1 cm in depth submucosal infiltration could be seen for approximately 4 cm within the left mainstem bronchi.  There were purulent thick secretions throughout the left-sided airways which were suctioned via trap and sent for culture.  The right mainstem was significantly obstructed (approximately 70%) extrinsically with the greatest degree obstruction just proximal to the right upper lobe takeoff.  The bronchus intermedius appeared uninvolved and was widely patent.  The right middle lobe was normal to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  In the proximal aspect of the right lower lobe was some black discoloration of the mucosa but did not appear to be malignant and there is no endobronchial disease or obstruction to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  
Following inspection the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced to the distal trachea and connected to the Jet ventilator.  The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. Forcep biopsies were taken of the proximal left mainstem mass.  Moderate bleeding was encountered which was treated with topical epinephrine.  After adequate samples were taken APC was used to burn and shave the lesion using the tip of the bronchoscope to remove the devascularized tissue as well as forceps to remove associated debris.  After debulking the left mainstem was approximately 90% patent throughout.  Due to the carinal involvement with fistulization as well as the right mainstem extrinsic obstruction decision was made to place a silicone Y stent into the airway. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 40mm in the tracheal limb, 25mm in the right mainstem limb and 45mm in the left mainstem limb.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and we initially attempted to insert the stent using Freitag forceps with indirect laryngoscopy.  This was unsuccessful and at one point the stent was deployed within the proximal esophagus.  The LMA was removed at that point and an endotracheal tube inserted after which we navigated into the proximal esophagus with the flexible bronchoscope, identified the stent and removed with flexible forceps.  After aborting attempts at Freitag placement a 14 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the airway for dimensional stent deployment.  The Rigid bronchoscope was then advanced to the proximal right mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The Stent was well seated. The trachea and left mainstem were widely patent and the area of disease mucosa within the left mainstem was completely covered.  The right mainstem only improved in diameter to approximately 50% of normal due to continued extrinsic compression on the stent from her esophageal mass. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed.  After removal of the bronchoscope it was noted that the patient had a small laceration on her tongue which developed during the procedure.
Complications: Small tongue laceration
Estimated blood loss: 10 cc
Recommendations:
- Transfer PACU
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- ENT consult to evaluate tongue laceration
- Patient will transfer back to the VA once PACU discharge criteria are met.  
- Nebulized hypertonic (3%) saline 3 cc mixed with 2 cc of albuterol TID for stent maintenance and clearance of secretions.  Patient will need to have a home nebulizer arranged prior to discharge to home.
- Patient to follow-up in the interventional pulmonary clinic in one month or earlier if any issues develop which require earlier evaluation.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: left upper and lower lobe obstruction 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Presumed malignant obstruction of left upper and lower lobe
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: flexible bronchoscopy with cryodebulking, electrocautery snare and APC..
INDICATIONS: bilobar collapse  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was normal. On the right there was a small focus of tumor just prximal to the right upper lobe at the anterior wall which was non-obstructive. The right sided airways were otherwise normal. The left mainstem was normal.  At the takeoff of the left lower lobe there was a vascular appearing endobronchial mass causing complete airway obstruction. At the takeoff of the left upper lobe there was a similar appearing vascular endobronchial lesion causing complete airway obstruction. With gentile manipulation of the tumor it was noted to bleed easily. APC was used to devascularize the superficial layer of the left upper and lower lobe tumors.  The electrocautery snare was then used to remove the prximal portion of the left upper lobe tumor after which we cold visualize distal airways. The tumor extended to just proximal to the lingual take-off and distally there did not appear to be evidence of active tumor.  Using APC we used the burn and shave method to slowly debulk the tumor as well as flexible forceps debulking of charred tumor after APC cauterization. Bleeding was moderate and resolved with topical instillation of 1:1000 TXA through the bronchoscope. After debulking in the left upper lobe we had complete opening of the lobar and segmental bronchi. We then brought our attention to the left lower lobe lesion. Using the electrocautery snare in a similar fashion we were able to debulk the proximal tumor. There was much more extensive distal tumor in the lower lobe with tumor involving multiple segmental bronchi. Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract some of the tissue after which we utilized APC and flexible forceps in a similar fashion as performed in the left upper lobe to slowly debulk the tumor. We were able to open the left lower lobe orifice to approximately 70% of normal but despite our best efforts we could not completely remove the tumor due to the extent of disease and distal tumor infiltration. APC was used at the end of the procedure to paint cauterize any active oozing and once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: lung cancer with complete left mainstem stenosis. 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem
INDICATIONS: Obstruction of left mainstem bronchus
Consent was obtained from the family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the posterior oropharynx. The ETT was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. Airway inspection was performed and the tracheal and right sided airways were normal. At the proximal aspect of the left mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing complete obstruction of the airway. Using the 2.4 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract portions of the tumor slowly and further extraction was performed using utilized APC and flexible forceps to “burn and shave” the remaining until eventually the LC1 carina was seen. In the left upper lobe the airways appeared normal without evidence of tumor while in the left lower lobe mucosal tumor invasion was present but non-obstructive to at least the first subsegments. Although we were able to debulk the majority of tumor in the mainstem there remained significant residual tumor burden causing partial airway obstruction and it was decided to place and Aero SEMS to maintain patency and for barrier effect. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope into the left lower lobe past the mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted and the stent was evaluated and was in appropriate position with a residual airway of >90% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and bronchoscopic intubation was performed with an 8.0 ETT and the procedure was completed.
Recommendations:
-          Transfer back to ICU
-          Post-procedure x-ray
-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.
-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer with tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Extensive tumor infiltration within the bronchus intermedius extending into the right lower lobe as well as less extensive tumor infiltration in the right upper lobe.
2.	Post-obstructive pneumonia
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy
INDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the flexible bronchoscope was inserted into the posterior oropharynx via an LMA. The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the distal right mainstem completely obstructive tumor and mucous was seen. The mucous was suctioned and tumor obstructive tumor was visualized in the proximal BI just below the right upper lobe. There was yellow plaques through the right mainstem extending into the right upper lobe with an appearance consistent with radiation bronchitis. Within the right upper lobe there was a combination of tumor and radiation bronchitis resulting in occlusion of the apical and anterior segments and about 80% obstruction of the posterior segment. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we identified a small orifice in the tumor within the bronchus intermedius which had a stricture like appearance. The electrocautery knife was used to make radial incisions after which large volume of pus was expressed for the distal airways. A trap was placed and the purulent material was suctioned and collected for culture. We were unable to pass the thin bronchoscope through the orifice or insert a CRE balloon due to the size.    We then began to slowly debulk the endobronchial tumor through the use of a combination of APC, and forceps. We continued to debulk the tumor and utilizing an 6-7-8 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 70% recanalization of the proximal and mid broncus intermedius and the proximal right lower lobe orifice. A small opening was identified leading to the distal BI where we could see the orifice of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe however there was extensive tumor infiltration which continued into the lobar bronchi. The right middle lobe orifice was also encased with extensive tumor and we could only achieve about 10% recanalization. Infiltrating friable areas of tumor were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Due to the extent of tumor within the distal airways we did not believe that airway stent placement would be appropriate as distal tumor ingrowth would likely occur. We then addressed the right upper lobe where we were able to gently debulk tumor with APC and flexible forceps to where the apical and anterior segments (which were anatomically fused could be identified. Utilizing a 6-7-8 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 85% recanalization of the anterior apical and posterior segmental orifices.  Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
We expect the obstruction to recur due to the extent of tumor involvement. 
Patient likely is not a candidate for additional radiation therapy given the apparent radiation bronchitis. Will need to discuss options with medical oncologist 
Patient was given a 10 day course of Augmentin due to the extensive post-obstructive pneumonia which was discovered and evacuated during bronchoscopy
Will obtain repeat CT of the chest for assessment of distal airways post-procedure.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer with tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant intrinsic airway obstruction
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial dubulking
INDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia a 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung and right upper lobe appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right upper lobe there was mucosal tumor infiltration causing partial (about 30% obstruction of the lobe). Just distal to the right upper lobe orifice in the bronchus intermedius there was a large polypoid tumor with base on the lateral wall causing complete airway obstruction.  At this point the flexible forceps were used to take tissue samples for pathological evaluation.  We then attempted to secure the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare however were unable to get the snare to wrap around the distal aspect and this was subsequently aborted. We then used the ND-YAG  began to slowly devascularize. After which the rigid optic was reinserted and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced to the level of the lesion and using an apple coring technique with the bevel of the rigid bronchoscope we were able to cut through stock of the lesion. We then reinserted the flexible bronchoscope and using suction were able to secure the free lesion and remove en-block with suction. After this the airway was essentially open however there was significant residual mucosal tumor at the base and extending to the level of the basilar branches of the right lower lobe obstructing both the middle lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe. The middle lobe and superior segment were found and opened to approximately 50% of normal diameter.  APC was used to debulk the residual tumor using a burn and shave technique as well as flexible forceps to remove coagulated debris. We were able to achieve approximately 85% recanalization of the proximal bronchus intermedius, and 60% of the distal BI. A similar technique was then used to remove the mucosal infiltrating tumor at the orifice of the right upper lobe with end result approximately 80% recanalization. Placement of a stent to prevent re-ingrowth was considered however based on the patient’s wishes (to avoid stent unless absolutely necessary) as well as the need to likely “jail” the right middle lobe and superior segment with the stent we decided to forgo this intervention and see how patient responds both clinically and to any possible systemic therapy which might prevent recurrence. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis for confirmation of recurrence 
Obtain CXR in PACU.
We expect the obstruction to recur without systemic treatment and possibly radiation due to the extent of tumor involvement. Will discuss with patients primary oncologist regarding options for systemic therapy. ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass with left main-stem obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis
ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.
If patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. 
If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass with right main-stem obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant intrinsic airway obstruction
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
INDICATIONS: right mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once adequate anesthesia and muscle relaxation were achieved a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted past the vocal cords and into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection, the trachea was normal without evidence of endobronchial or extrinsic obstruction. The left aspect of the carina was sharp and left sided airways were normal to at least the first sub-segmental bronchi. On the right there was near complete endobronchial tumor obstruction (95%) in the right mainstem at extending beyond the right upper lobe stump into the bronchus intermedius. Endobronchial forceps biopsies were performed in the right mainstem. After which the FIO2 was reduced to 30% and argon plasma coagulation was used to superficially burn the obstructive tumor followed by shaving of charred tumor with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope and removal of loose fragments using flexible forceps. This was repeated until eventually we were able to achieve about 85% re-canalization of the proximal right sided airways. Once the main obstruction was bypassed, in the distal bronchus intermedius there was significant submucosal tumor infiltration causing at least 80% obstruction up to the level of the right middle lobe stump. APC was used in a similar fashion to debulk resulting in about 70% re-canalization.   Anatomic distortion (bronchial kink) was seen further obstructing the right lower lobe (approximately 40%) but within the right lower lobe the airways were widely patient. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria are met 
- Urgent radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the right sided airways in an attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant central airway obstruction. 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Intraoperative death.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial debulking and balloon dilatation. 
INDICATIONS: Right mainstem endobronchial obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. The T180 theraputic flexible bronchoscope was insterted through the rigid bronchoscope and airway inspection was performed. The proximal and mid trachea were normal. There was tumor infiltration within the distal trachea just proximal to the main carina on the right lateral wall with slowly oozing blood visualized. That main carina was involved on the right side. The left sided aiways were normal.  The proximal right mainstem was completely obstructed with friable enbdobronchial tumor APC was used to burn and shave the tumor and flexible forceps were used for biopsy. As we slowly debulked the tumor it became clear that the involvement was extensive. Using the P90 slim bronchoscope we were able to bypass tumor using saline aliquots to stent the airway open and eventually could visualize the basilar segments of the lower lobe where persistent tumor was seen. Using a forgery balloon and the pullback method we were able to dilate the airway slightly and then using an 8,9,10 CRE balloon gently dilated the BI and RLL bronchus. While bleeding was encountered it was not brisk and was controlled with tropical TXA, epi and cold saline. While considering stent placement the patient’s blood pressure began to slowly drop despite increasing vasopressor requirement and patient went into PEA/Asystole. Code blue was called and CRP initiated. A left sided chest tube was placed and there was no gush of air concerning for PTX. Ultrasound showed no cardiac motion and no evidence of pericardial effusion. Patient received multiple doses of epinephrine and chest compressions but remained in non-shockable rhythm (asystole).  Decision was made to attempt TPA given that all other H’s and T’s were considered and not apparent. This did not have any effect. While we were confident that a right sided PTX was not present (lung completely obstructed by tumor and atelectatic) A right sided chest tube was placed to attempt to offload pressure from known pleural effusion again without response. At hat 15:10 after approximately 30 minutes of CPR the patient was declared dead. Family was notified and handled information appropriately. Medical examiner was contacted and declined case.  
Complications:  Intra-operative death (direct cause unclear)

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant lung mass with left lower lobe and partial left main-stem obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant airway obstruction 
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal. In the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.  The LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal. Most of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes. After extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL. The tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.  APC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor. At the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed. The left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent. The lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Transfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria met. 
Will discuss with oncology if biopsy samples obtained during procedure need any specific mutational analysis. 
Defer to oncology regarding medical and radiation treatment. 
Will monitor for symptoms or radiographic signs of tumor regrowth and possible need for repeat debulking to salvage left upper lobe.","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure secondary extrinsic tracheal compression
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement
INDICATIONS: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent was obtained from the patient’s family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. The patient was sedated in the upright position and once anesthesia was comfortable that she could be ventilated, muscle relaxation was given and the patient was laid flat. A 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced past the near complete mid-tracheal extrinsic compression and connected to the Jet ventilator while in the distal trachea.  The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. The distal trachea was approximately 60% obstructed extrinsically. The proximal 2/3 of the left mainstem were extrinsically compressed by about 50%. The distal left mainstem and left sided airways were normal the right mainstem and distal airways appeared normal without compression, mucosal changes or endobronchial disease.  After measuring the airways we customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 90mm in the tracheal limb, 16mm in the right mainstem limb and 33mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. During this short period patient was difficult to ventilate and oxygen desaturation occurred. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted. She was easily ventilated and oxygen saturation quickly returned to normal. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The Stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords. The mid-stent was compressed by the extrinsic force of the mediastinal mass to 60% of normal. The left mainstem and right mainstem were widely patent. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. 
Recommendations:
- Transfer back  to ICU
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- TID hypertonic nebulizers with albuterol (3cc 3% and 2cc albuterol) to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent
- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
- Discuss with IR for biopsy
- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.
- If invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.	
- Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent. ","{

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure secondary extrinsic tracheal compression
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement, bronchoscopic intubation
INDICATIONS: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent was obtained from the patient’s family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete
Post procedure diagnosis:
Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent. 
Recommendations:
·	Transfer to ICU
·	Obtain post procedure CXR

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Complex Tracheal stenosis s/p stent placement 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Tracheal self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords was a long segment of A-shaped stenosis measuring 3.5 cm with maximal airway obstruction of 90%.  Distal to the stenosis the mid and distal trachea appeared normal. All right and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were examined and normal without endobronchial disease or airway distortion. External markers were placed on the patient’s chest with fluoroscopic observation at the proximal and distal edges of the stenosis. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea through the flexible bronchoscope. The bronchoscope was then removed with the jagwire left in place. A 16x40 mm Ultraflex uncovered self-expandable metallic stent was then inserted over the guidewire and using the external markers positioned in proper place and then deployed. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted. The stent was well positioned and partially compressed externally. A 14/16.5/18 mm Elation dilatational balloon was used to dilate the stent after which the airway was approximately 90% of normal caliber.  At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.
- Plan for repeat evaluation and possible stent replacement in approximately 2 weeks.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula presumed malignant tracheal obstruction 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula with mixed intrinsic/extrinsic presumed malignant tracheal obstruction 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Dual tracheal self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula with tracheal obstruction
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 3 cm distal to the vocal cords was a long segment of airway obstruction from extrinsic compression as well as submucosal infiltration. At the maximum obstruction (mid trachea the airway was approximately 70% obstructed. The tumor was mostly confined to the posterior and left lateral wall. At the distal aspect of the tumor (3cm proximal to the main carina there was an obvious fistulous communication with the esophagus in the left recess between the posterior and lateral tracheal wall.  The distal 3 cm of the trachea appeared normal. There was purulent material in the left mainstem which was suctioned and all airways beyond the trachea appeared normal without evidence of mucosal irregularities of endobronchial disease. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea and with bronchoscopic observation placed a 16x60 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent. The stent deployed more distally than expected with the distal edge within the right mainstem and the proximal edge not fully covering the obstruction. We were able to pull the stent proximally but slightly more proximal than expected to cover the upper tracheal obstruction but the distal margin and TE fistula remained exposed.  At this point our thought was that the obstruction was covered and that GI would place a stent to cover the fistula. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and GI then attempted through EGD to place the stent but were unable to bypass the esophageal obstruction. We then re-intubated with the tracheoscope and using a similar technique to before and using forceps biopsied the exposed tumor. We then placed a second 16X60 aero SEM into the distal trachea telescoping into the more proximal stent. This resulted in complete occlusion of the fistula and complete opening of the trachea to a normal diameter. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. Once the patient was felt to be able to adequately protect airway the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Post procedure diagnosis:
Mixed infiltrative tumor of the trachea and TE fistula s/p tracheal stenting with complete recanalization and obstruction of fistula 
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await tissue diagnosis
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- Transfer back to La Jolla oncology service 
- TID saline nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent","{

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula secondary to esophageal CA 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Tracheal self-expandable airway stent removal
INDICATIONS: Stent migration and presumed stent infection
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient’s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 

Post procedure diagnosis:
-	Stent infection
-	Stent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.
-	Persistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent 
-	s/p airway stent removal
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await cultures
- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula
- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheobronchomalacia
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheobronchomalacia
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent removal
INDICATIONS: Completed stent trial
 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Once the patient was sedated and relaxed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sublottic glottic space. A flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient’s Y stent was well placed without mucosal debris or obstruction. At the distal tip of the right limb was mild granulation tissue causing about 10% obstruction and at the distal tip of the left mild was moderate granulation tissue causing about 40% obstruction. The distal airways were widely patent.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optic was reinserted alongside rigid alligator forceps. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed an I-gel LMA was then placed and the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted.  There was some mild erythema in the areas of the struts from the move stent however the previously covered airways appeared to be relatively normal.  At this point  the cryotherapy probe was used to perform multiple 30 second freeze thaw cycles at the areas of residual granulation tissue within the left and right mainstems. There was some mild bleeding associated with the treatment on the left requiring cold saline and 2cc of topical epinephrine. Once we were confident that the bleeding had resolved the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.
 
Complications: None
EBL: 5
 
Recommendations:
-	Transfer to PACU 
-	Discharge patient once criteria is met
-	Due to lack of symptomatic response to stenting would not recommend consideration of tracheoplasty at this time. 
-	Recommend continuing of non-invasive ventilation for now.

"Preoperative Diagnosis:
•	Lung mass with complete left upper lobe and partial left lower lobe obstruction.
Postoperative Diagnosis:
•	Persistent tumor obstruction of the left mainstem, left upper, and left lower lobes.
Procedure Performed: 
•	Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
Indications: 
•	Airway obstruction and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: 
•	Obtained from the patient and their family after a detailed explanation of the procedure, potential risks, and alternatives.
Sedation: 
•	General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operatingroom. Following anesthetic induction, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea, where it was attached to the jet ventilator. A flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope.
Upon initial inspection, the trachea and right lung appeared normal, without evidence of endobronchial disease. The mid-left mainstem showed mucosal changes consistent with submucosal tumor involvement and lymphatic obstruction but was patent. At the LC2 carina, there was extensive tumor infiltration causing 100% obstruction of the left upper lobe and 95% obstruction of the left lower lobe. Purulent secretions were observed, and bronchial lavage with specimen collection for culture was performed.
Forceps biopsy was carried out on the visible endobronchial tumor, and samples were placed in formalin. The tumor was friable and bled upon contact. APC was used to revascularize the tumor, and a combination of flexible and rigid forceps, as well as cryotherapy, was employed for debulking. Additional biopsy samples were also collected and preserved in formalin.
During the procedure, a Fogarty balloon was passed into the lower lobe, inflated, and retracted in an attempt to open the airway. Copious purulent secretions were observed and suctioned following the maneuver. Despite this, due to the extent of the disease, adequate recanalization of the airway could not be achieved.
The patient experienced two episodes of significant hypoxia, with saturations dropping into the 50s. This required clot extraction, repositioning, and direct oxygen insufflation via the flexible bronchoscope. Saturations later stabilized to >90%.
Attempts to recanalize the airways were unsuccessful due to extensive disease. APC was again used for hemostasis. No further debulking was considered warranted at this time.
Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for continued care.
Complications:
•	None
Estimated Blood Loss: 
•	100cc
Recommendations:
•	Admit to ICU for overnight observation with a bronchial blocker available in case of massive hemoptysis.
•	Obtain a chest X-ray (CXR).
•	Await biopsy results.
•	Initiate palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) based on biopsy findings, as required.

"Preoperative Diagnosis:
•	Lung mass with complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and partial obstruction of the left upper lobe.
Postoperative Diagnosis:
•	Lung mass involving the left mainstem, left lower lobe, and left upper lobe.
Procedures Performed:
•	Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking.
•	EBUS mediastinal staging.
Indications: 
•	Airway obstruction and need for tissue biopsy.
Consent: 
•	Obtained from the patient and their family after a detailed explanation of the procedure, potential risks, and alternatives.
Sedation: 
•	General Anesthesia
Description of Procedure:
The patient received intravenous medications as recorded, and topical anesthesia was administered to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree. The T190 video bronchoscope was inserted orally via a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and navigated into the tracheobronchial tree, ensuring proper placement of the LMA. Observation of the vocal cords revealed no abnormalities, and the subglottic space was unremarkable. Initial examination showed the trachea and right lung to be normal, with no signs of endobronchial disease. The left mainstem from the proximal to mid-sections appeared normal. However, an endobronchial tumor was discovered in the distal left mainstem, causing approximately 85% airway obstruction. Successfully bypassing the initial obstruction, we visualized the LC2 carina extensively infiltrated by the tumor, completely obstructing the left lower lobe and obstructing 85% of the left upper lobe's takeoff. The tumor extended into the left upper lobe, fully obstructing it and compressing the lingula, which remained patent and unaffected. Following this, the Q190 bronchoscope was replaced with the UC180F convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope, introduced orally through the LMA and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree for a thorough assessment of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Stations 2R, 7, and 4L met the sampling criteria (5mm short-axis diameter), and station 4R, although smaller than 5mm, appeared round and hypoechoic, indicating suspicion. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed with Olympus EBUS TBNA 21 and 25-gauge needles on these nodes in the order of 4R, 2R, 7, and then 4L, with five biopsies taken at each station. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) found lymphocytes in all stations with no tumor invasion. The EBUS then provided ultrasound visualization of the lung mass in the distal left mainstem, with two 21-gauge needle passes yielding cytology samples without obvious tumor presence. All samples were forwarded for routine cytology analysis. Re-inserting the T190 bronchoscope, endobronchial biopsies of the tumor were performed, indicating malignancy through touch preps.

Subsequently, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was placed into the airway, connecting to a jet ventilator. A flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid one for additional forceps biopsies on the tumor, with samples preserved in formalin. The tumor was de-vascularized using argon plasma coagulation (APC) and gradually debulked through a ""burn and shave"" method using flexible forceps, supplemented by cryotherapy for effective tumor removal. During the procedure, a Fogarty balloon was employed in the lower lobe to facilitate airway opening, revealing and suctioning significant purulent secretions post-maneuver, and bronchial lavage for culture was conducted. Switching to the P190 ultra-slim bronchoscope revealed that tumor infiltration was evident throughout the left lower lobe into the distal segments. We then brought our attention to the left upper lobe and were able to visualize the superior and inferior lingula segments and subsegmental carinas, which showed no tumor infiltration. We were able to bypass the proximal tumor in the left upper lobe proper and open the proximal aspect of the anterior and apical posterior segments, however tumor presence was noted distally within the airways. Given the extensive nature of the disease, no further debulking was warranted, as re-cannulation would not be successful. After ensuring no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and the patient's care was transferred back to the anesthesia team for ongoing management.
Complications:
•	None Immediate 
Estimated Blood Loss: 
•	15cc
Recommendations:
•	Transfer the patient to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).
•	Obtain a chest X-ray.
•	Await the results of the biopsy.
•	Complete staging with PET and MRI of the brain, followed by presentation at the tumor board.
•	Discharge with a 7-day course of Augmentin.

"Preoperative Diagnosis:
Lung cancer.
Postoperative Diagnosis:
Lung cancer with malignant airway obstruction.
Procedure Performed:
•	Therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor cryoextraction, APC, and airway dilation.
•	EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA).
•	Balloon dilation and stent placement in the right lower lobe (RLL).
Indications:
1.	Lung cancer progression requiring repeat tissue sampling for molecular analysis.
2.	Malignant airway obstruction.
Consent:
Obtained from the patient after discussing the procedure, risks, and alternatives.
Sedation:
General anesthesia with an 8.5 mm endotracheal tube (ETT).
Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. The patient was positioned supine and underwent general anesthesia with an 8.5 mm ETT. Using the Olympus Q190 standard video-bronchoscope, the trachea was inspected and appeared clear. The left bronchial tree was visualized and found to be normal.
The right mainstem bronchus was clear, while the right upper lobe exhibited submucosal tumor growth with patent airways. The proximal bronchus intermedius (BI) displayed normal luminal structure with approximately 15% obstruction from extraluminal tumor. The distal BI was normal. The right middle lobe (RML) had 80% obstruction due to submucosal infiltration. The right lower lobe (RLL) was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.
The bronchoscope was exchanged for an EBUS scope. A 2.5 cm lymph node in station 11R1 was identified and biopsied using a 22G ViziShot-2 needle. Five passes were performed, and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy.
The procedure was then switched to a therapeutic bronchoscope (3.2 mm working channel). Forceps biopsies were taken from the proximal RLL, followed by tumor cryoextraction and ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC). A Fogarty balloon catheter was used to remove distal tumor and debris. Airway dilation of the RLL was performed with an 8-9-10 mm Elation balloon dilator.
The RLL superior segment remained near-completely obstructed, but visualization revealed mostly uninvolved basilar segments with minimal tumor involvement. A 10 x 15 mm Aero stent was placed in the RLL, with the proximal edge positioned just distal to the RML and jailing the superior segment. The basilar segments were patent beyond the stent. The stent was further dilated using a 10-11-12 mm Elation balloon. Post-procedure, the RLL was approximately 85% patent.
The procedure concluded without complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).
Complications:
None.
Estimated Blood Loss:
Minimal.
Recommendations:
1.	Transfer to PACU for post-procedural monitoring.
2.	Return to inpatient service when appropriate.
3.	Await pathology results for NGS and PD-L1 analysis.
4.	Notify the oncology team at UCSD of the findings and procedural outcomes.

"PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
POST- PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscope and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within apico-posterior branch of left upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion. Although we were able to navigate directly to the lesion with navigation the radial probe view was suboptimal. Biopsy was performed initially with triple needle brush and TBNA needle. ROSE did not reveal evidence to support that we were within the lesion. Multiple attempts were made to manipulate the catheter and biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, and forceps, brush under fluoroscopic visualization. The specimens reviewed on-site remained suboptimal.  Multiple forceps biopsies were performed within the location of the lesion and placed in cell-block. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

"PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
POST- PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with transbronchial needle aspiration, Transbronchial biopsy and bronchioalveolar lavage.  

INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscope and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within apico-posterior branch of left upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion. Although we were able to navigate directly to the lesion with navigation the radial probe view was suboptimal. Biopsy was performed initially with triple needle brush and TBNA needle. ROSE did not reveal evidence to support that we were within the lesion. Multiple attempts were made to manipulate the catheter and biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, and forceps, brush under fluoroscopic visualization. The specimens reviewed on-site remained suboptimal.  Multiple forceps biopsies were performed within the location of the lesion and placed in cell-block. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None 
COMPLICATIONS:                 None

IMPRESSION:  
- S/P bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage.
- Suboptimal navigational localization 
RECOMMENDATIONS
- Transfer to post-procedural unit
- Post-procedure CXR
- D/C home once criteria met
- Await pathology","{

"PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
POST- PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE CAVITARY PULMONARY NODULE
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with transbronchial needle aspiration, Transbronchial biopsy and bronchioalveolar lavage.  
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the laryngeal airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion right upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion and minor adjustments were made in positioning until a concentric US view was obtained.  Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, forceps, and brush under fluoroscopic visualization. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. Specimens were sent for both microbiological and cytology/histology assessment.

INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   multiple pulmonary nodules suspicious for malignancy            
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record the patient was intubated with an 8. 0 ET tube by anesthesia. The T190 video bronchoscope was then introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational map created preprocedurally we advanced the 190 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the right lower lobe nodule. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion and minor adjustments were made in positioning until a concentric US view was obtained.  Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, forceps, and triple needle brush under fluoroscopic visualization. Rapid Onsite pathological evaluation was consistent with malignancy. Airway inspection was then performed to evaluate for any evidence of active bleeding and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. Specimens were sent for cytology/histology assessment.

"PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
POST- PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with transbronchial needle aspiration, Transbronchial biopsy and bronchioalveolar brush.  
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
Pre-operative diagnosis: Right upper lobe nodule
Post-operative diagnosis: SAA
Anesthesia: General per Anesthesia
PROCEDURE: History and physical has been performed. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained. Patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by the physician, anesthesia team, nurse, and pulmonary team. Time out was performed at 0819. The bronchoscope was introduced through the laryngeal mask airway and into the trachea.  The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree of bilateral lungs was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. The right upper lobe was noted to have an anomalous inferior takeoff in addition to the anterior, apical, and posterior segments. There were no endobronchial lesions and no excessive secretions.
 The Covidien superDimension probe was then advanced and registration was performed. The right upper lobe nodule was accessed by the anomalous segment (see below), located using electromagnetic navigation and the site confirmed with radial ultrasound. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed under flouroscopic guidance and adequate tissue confirmed by ROSE. Multiple insturments to include transbronchoscopic needles, forceps (tranbronchial lung biopsy) and brushes were utilized. Five needle biopsies three forceps biopsies, and one needle brush biopsy were obtained in total. Finally, inspection bronchoscopy was performed and hemostasis was confirmed. The procedure was accomplished without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. EBL 5cc.

SPECIMEN SENT TO THE LABORATORY:
--5 needle biopsies of the right middle lobe
--1 brush biopsies of the  right middle lobe
--3 forceps biopsies

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-D/C From CEC when discharge criteria are met
-Patient will be notified when biopsy results return

"Procedure Name: 
1.	radial EBUS guided bronchoscopy with TNBA and endobronchial biopsies
2.	Bronchoscopic intubation 
Indications: Lung cancer with suspicion for recurrence 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. Somewhat thick secretions were seen throughout the airways. The left sided airway anatomy was normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just proximal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Within that segment fibrotic endoluminal obstruction was seen but all other airways did not have visual endobronchial disease to at least the first sub-segmental level. Due to difficulty with maintaining position of LMA (edentulous) the decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. This was performed over the bronchoscope without difficulty and the ETT was secured approximately 2 cm above the main carina. Once the ETT was connected to ventilator, The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted through the tube and advanced to the orifice of the accessory left lower lobe bronchus and the radial ultrasound was advanced through the scope into the sub-segment and a concentric view of the lesion was visualized within the segment. Multiple forceps biopsies were then performed. The lesion was extremely firm and samples were relatively scant. We then utilized the super-dimension 21G peripheral needle and the 19G Olympus peripheral needle to obtain a total of 6 endobronchial needle biopsies of the lesion which were placed in formalin. After adequate samples were obtained repeat inspection was performed and no evidence of bleeding or other complications were seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe accessory segment fibrotic endobronchial lesion.
- Await final pathology  ","{

"Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy and tumor debulking
Indications: endobronchial nodule in setting of widely metastatic disease requiring tissue diagnosis. 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. airway and tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. The right upper and middle lobe were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. Within the right lower lobe a polypoid  endobronchial tumor was visualized obstructing the anterior, lateral and posterior basilar segments just distal to the medial basal segment. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Using the electrocautery snare we were able to remove the endobronchial lesion which was sent for pathological evaluation. The distal airways were noted to have purulent post-obstructive secretions which were suctioned and removed. Mild bleeding was seen at the base and using APC non-contact electrocautery we were able to cauterize this area. Post intervention the right lower lobe was approximately 90% patient.  After observing the area of interest to ensure there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 


Complications: 
-None 
Estimated Blood Loss:  10 cc.

"Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy with endobronchial glue instillation 
Indications: Post-pneumonectomy broncho-pleural fistula
Medications: Per anesthesia
Patient intubated by anesthesia with 8.5 ETT prior to case. The Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through ETT and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. ETT tip was approximately 4cm above carina. The distal trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level and bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal without endobronchial lesions or secretions. The left mainstem stump was then visualized with obvious pinpoint BP fistula, the remained of the stump appeared to be intact however we did not probe the stump due to concern for extending the fistula. At this point the Veno-seal sealant delivery system catheter was advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope and glue was then carefully applied to seal the fistula which appeared to be successful. The bronchoscope was then removed and our portion of the procedure was completed. 
Complications: none

"Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy and peripheral biopsy
Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 7. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation revealed benign lymphocytes. The bronchoscope was then removed and the PX190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe to the area of known nodule within the Apical-posterior segment the lesion was identified visually. Biopsies were then performed with micro forceps.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy within the lesion.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 re-inserted into the airways. We then observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 
Complications: 	
-None 
Estimated Blood Loss:  less than 5 cc.
Recommendations:
- Transfer to post-op ward
- Await biopsy results 
- Discharge home once criteria met.","{

"Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy
Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of what appears to be a fused anterior segment of left upper lobe with lingula. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 4R. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet in AHLTA. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation did not identify malignancy. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe to the area of known nodule within the anterior segment and an eccentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 re-inserted into the airways. DECAMP research samples were then performed with brushing within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies in the RUL, RML and LUL. We ten observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 

Complications: 	
-None 
Estimated Blood Loss:  10 cc.
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await biopsy results 
- Discharge home once criteria met.","{

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. The right upper and lower lobe airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. Within the right middle lobe a shiny vascular obstructive endobronchial tumor was visualized within the lateral segment of the right middle lobe. The lesion was friable and bled easily with minimal manipulation. Subsequently 6 endobronchial needle biopsies of the nodule were performed. Due to bleeding from the lesion a total of 4ml of 10mg/10ml tranexamic acid was applied topically with subsequent resolution of bleeding.  The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4L, station 4R, station 7 and station 11Rs lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning at the N3 (4L) lymph nodes 74R11Rs. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet in AHLTA. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation did not identify malignancy. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and inserted the therapeutic T190 Olympus bronchoscope and advanced the scope into the right middle lobe where 5 forceps endobronchial biopsies were performed. Bleeding was moderate and required intermittent mechanical tamponade with the tip of the bronchoscope. After biopsies were completed we monitored for evidence of active bleeding and none was seen. At this point the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 


Complications: 
-None 
Estimated Blood Loss:  10 cc.
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await biopsy results 
- Discharge home once criteria met.

"Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage
Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy and interstitial lung disease 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the station 4R lymph node, followed by the station 7 lymph node and finally the 4L lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as benign lymphoid tissue in all sampled nodes. All samples were sent for routine cytology and flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. Using fluoroscopy transbronchial forceps lung biopsies were performed in both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Finally BAL was performed with 120cc instillation and 40cc return. Prior to removing the bronchoscope an airway examination was performed and no evidence of active bleeding was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage

"Procedure Name: Electromagnetic navigational and radial EBUS guided bronchoscopy
Indications: right upper lobe nodule
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we were able to advance the 45 degree edge catheter into the anterior segment on the right upper lobe and navigated to within 1cm of the lesion. The navigational probe was then removed and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded a concentric view affirming the location.  Needle biopsies were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE showed abundant lymphocytes and inflammatory cells but no obvious malignancy. Tissue biopsies were then performed using forceps under fluoroscopic visualization. After samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the diagnostic bronchoscope was re-inserted into the airway. Subsequent inspection did not show evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed from the airway. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful electromagnetic navigation and biopsy of right upper lobe nodule. 
- Await path and flow results

"Procedure Name: Peripheral bronchoscopy with radial EBUS localization.
Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of what appears to be a fused anterior segment of left upper lobe with lingula. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 Therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway.  A sheath catheter was advanced through the working channel into the segment of suspicion. A radial US was advanced through the sheath and concentric view of lesion was seen. Using fluoroscopy, transbronchial needle biopsies were performed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy. We then performed 6 bronchoscopic lung biopsies in the same area under fluoroscopic visualization with forceps.   
We then removed the therapeutic scope and re0inserted the Q190 videoscope. After cleaning of blood and debris no active bleeding and none was identified. Fluoroscopy was then used to scan for evidence of pneumothorax which was not seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

"Procedure Name: Peripheral radial EBUS guided bronchoscopy
Indications: left lower lobe pulmonary nodule 
Medications: via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left lower lobe to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy and unable to clearly identify that adequate sampling was performed.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful peripheral radial probe guided eccentric localization 
- Will await final pathology results ","{

"Procedure Name: Pleuroscopy
Indications: Pleural effusion
Medications: Fentanyl 3, versed 75, Lidocaine 30cc 1%
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 800cc of dark bloody fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There were multiple thick adhesions and areas of lung tethering to the posterior chest wall. We were unable to identify the diaphragm or apex due to fused lung that would have required extensive lysis to pass. There was extensive inflammation in the adhered lung which we could peel away relatively easily in the thinner areas to expose parietal pleura which was generally normal appearing.  The 5mm port could not fit the optical forceps and we then exchanged the it for a disposable 8mm trochar. Biopsies of the parietal pleura posteriorly as well as areas of non-ventilated fused lung adherent to the pleural (non-functional appearing) were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was no significant bleeding. The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. 

PleurX Catheter Placement:

A guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract. A 16 fr peel away sheath was inserted over the wire via seldinger technique. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and minimal serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The patient’s wife was then brought into the room for drainage draining and a PleurX bottle was attached to the catheter and approximate 75cc of bloody fluid was obtained. The catheter tip was then capped and the PleurX was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing. 

The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed pleural catheter in place.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 75cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Will await pathology and microbiological studies
Patient education on pleural catheter draining performed and patient and wife will return to clinic if needed for more training.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with isocyanate green dye injection for surgical resection.
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   pulmonary nodules requiring surgical resection
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record the patient was intubated with an 8. 5 ET tube by anesthesia. The T190 video bronchoscope was then introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational map created preprocedurally we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the right upper lobe nodule. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion.  A super dimension needle was then inserted through the bronchoscope and 0.75 milliliters of isocyanate Green were injected just below the pleura adjacent to the nodule for planned robotic surgical resection immediately following. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was turned over to cardiothoracic surgery. 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   less than 5 cc 
COMPLICATIONS: None

"PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below.   The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. There were no complications. Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

"REOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute respiratory failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.	Mucous plugging within trachea. 
2.	left mainstem stent with partial obstruction from adherent mucous  

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  flexible bronchoscopy 
SEDATION: None
TOPICAL ANESTHESIA:  18 cc 1% lidocaine 
SPECIMENS SENT: None
FINDINGS:  
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
The procedure was performed emergently.  After patient's clinic visit while I was in a separate room with another patient the patient abruptly entered and indicated that he was choking and couldn't breathe.  He was quickly taken into the bronchoscopy suite at which point lidocaine was injected into his right Nair and deep tracheal suction was attempted with tracheal suction catheter however symptoms persisted.  The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through his right Nair without sedation and into his posterior oropharynx where additional 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords.  The bronchoscope was then passed into the trachea where a thick plug of mucus was visualized and suctioned.  We then inspected the airways further and found other areas of mucus within both the right and the left-sided airways and within his left-sided mainstem stent there was adherent thick mucus causing approximately 50% obstruction which was also suctioned with about 95% recanalization of the stent.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.  The patient’s symptoms completely resolved and he was sensibly sent to the emergency department for evaluation and possible admission given the acute severe event.
Complications none

"Procedure Name: Peripheral bronchoscopy with radial EBUS localization.
Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of what appears to be a fused anterior segment of left upper lobe with lingula. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 Therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway.  A sheath catheter was advanced through the working channel into the segment of suspicion. A radial US was advanced through the sheath and concentric view of lesion was seen. Using fluoroscopy, transbronchial needle biopsies were performed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy. We then performed 6 bronchoscopic lung biopsies in the same area under fluoroscopic visualization with forceps.   
We then removed the therapeutic scope and re0inserted the Q190 videoscope. After cleaning of blood and debris no active bleeding and none was identified. Fluoroscopy was then used to scan for evidence of pneumothorax which was not seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 


Complications:

Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy and unable to clearly identify that adequate sampling was performed.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

"Procedure Name: Pleuroscopy
Indications: Pleural effusion
Medications: Fentanyl 3, versed 75, Lidocaine 30cc 1%
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 800cc of dark bloody fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There were multiple thick adhesions and areas of lung tethering to the posterior chest wall. We were unable to identify the diaphragm or apex due to fused lung that would have required extensive lysis to pass. There was extensive inflammation in the adhered lung which we could peel away relatively easily in the thinner areas to expose parietal pleura which was generally normal appearing.  The 5mm port could not fit the optical forceps and we then exchanged the it for a disposable 8mm trochar. Biopsies of the parietal pleura posteriorly as well as areas of non-ventilated fused lung adherent to the pleural (non-functional appearing) were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was no significant bleeding. The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. 

PleurX Catheter Placement:

A guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract. A 16 fr peel away sheath was inserted over the wire via seldinger technique. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and minimal serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The patient’s wife was then brought into the room for drainage draining and a PleurX bottle was attached to the catheter and approximate 75cc of bloody fluid was obtained. The catheter tip was then capped and the PleurX was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing. 

The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed pleural catheter in place.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 75cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Will await pathology and microbiological studies
Patient education on pleural catheter draining performed and patient and wife will return to clinic if needed for more training.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with isocyanate green dye injection for surgical resection.
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   pulmonary nodules requiring surgical resection
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record the patient was intubated with an 8. 5 ET tube by anesthesia. The T190 video bronchoscope was then introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational map created preprocedurally we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the right upper lobe nodule. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion.  A super dimension needle was then inserted through the bronchoscope and 0.75 milliliters of isocyanate Green were injected just below the pleura adjacent to the nodule for planned robotic surgical resection immediately following. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was turned over to cardiothoracic surgery. 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   less than 5 cc 
COMPLICATIONS: None

"PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below.   The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. There were no complications. Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

"REOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute respiratory failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.	Mucous plugging within trachea. 
2.	left mainstem stent with partial obstruction from adherent mucous  

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  flexible bronchoscopy 
SEDATION: None
TOPICAL ANESTHESIA:  18 cc 1% lidocaine 
SPECIMENS SENT: None
FINDINGS:  
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
The procedure was performed emergently.  After patient's clinic visit while I was in a separate room with another patient the patient abruptly entered and indicated that he was choking and couldn't breathe.  He was quickly taken into the bronchoscopy suite at which point lidocaine was injected into his right Nair and deep tracheal suction was attempted with tracheal suction catheter however symptoms persisted.  The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through his right Nair without sedation and into his posterior oropharynx where additional 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords.  The bronchoscope was then passed into the trachea where a thick plug of mucus was visualized and suctioned.  We then inspected the airways further and found other areas of mucus within both the right and the left-sided airways and within his left-sided mainstem stent there was adherent thick mucus causing approximately 50% obstruction which was also suctioned with about 95% recanalization of the stent.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.  The patient’s symptoms completely resolved and he was sensibly sent to the emergency department for evaluation and possible admission given the acute severe event.
Complications none

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	14	375	12	100	10	15
 
Target 1: Lingular nodule
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
Target 2: LUL anterior
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Cryobiopsy was attempted but was technically challenging - unable to penetrate the airway wall to achieve consistent biopsy.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
200mg of TXA was placed into LUL to achieve hemostasis. 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
 
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node waswas < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
 
All other lymph node stations did not have any detectable lymph nodes noted. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA, TBCBX, Brush, BAL lingula nodule
TBNA LUL nodule.
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:  Erica Nunley is a 88 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung nodules.

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:

Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	14	375	15	100	10	20
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB10).  Target lesion is about 1.5 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Cells present causing suspicion of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
Site 3: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

ASSISTANT:   none
 
Support Staff: 
RN: Rebecca Loman
RT: Frank Fellers
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
NBI was used to assess the airway and nodular changes was noted. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), and LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1).  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the lesion LLL is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .  No vessels were noted. 
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps at Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle, 19-gauge Needle, and Cryoprobe 1.1mm.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 2: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
Site 3: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

RT: Philip Knight
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Therapeutic bronchoscope was parked in RML; lateral segment was engaged.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle and 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
ROSE from procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 2R (upper paratracheal) node
2L (upper paratracheal) node
4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 3: The 11Rs lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius  from mucus. 
 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12 	300	12	100	10	15
 
RUL Mass: 
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 4.0 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric after initial needle puncture into the lesion.  The following features were noted: continuous margin, heterogenous echotexture.
 
Once a tunnel had been created into the lesion with TBNA as above, Transbronchial microwave ablation was performed of the nodule as below. 
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Microwave 	Medium Antenna 	90*C	20:00 min	Transbronchial Ablation of Nodule
 
 
Subsequently, RB2 was engaged.  And microwave catheter was placed in the lateral superior aspect of the lung mass. CBCT was done to confirm the location. 
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Microwave 	Medium Antenna 	90*C	10:00 min	Transbronchial Ablation of Nodule
 
Subsequently, RB1 was engaged.  And microwave catheter was placed in the superior medial aspect of the lung mass. CBCT was done to confirm the location. 
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Microwave 	Medium Antenna 	90*C	10:00 min	Transbronchial Ablation of Nodule
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. The images confirmed tool-in-lesion. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S):

"DATE OF PROCEDURE: 12/16/2025   CC Referred Physician: Self, Referred No address on file   INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Sarah Jenkins is a 54 year old-year-old female who presents with Pleural Effusion. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Chest tube placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.   CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.   PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pleural Effusion POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above.   PROCEDURE:  76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation 32557 Insert catheter pleura with imaging (chest tube)   76604 was performed on the right side   ATTENDING:  John Smith, MD   ASSISTANT:   Mary Clark  MD   Support Staff: RN: Bedside RN   MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.   PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.   PATIENT POSITION: ‌ Supine  ‌ Sitting   X ‌ Lateral Decubitus: ‌ Left X‌ Right   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS:  X ‌ Image saved and up loaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   X ‌ Right ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ Minimal  ‌ Small ‌ Moderate X ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌X Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ X None  ‌Thin  ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X ‌ Normal  ‌ Diminished;  ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ X Present  ‌ Absent Pleura:  ‌ X Normal  ‌ Thick ‌ Nodular   Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine 1%: 10__ ml     Other: ______ Entry Site: X ‌ Right 7-8_ Intercostal Space   ‌ Left ___ Intercostal Space ‌ Mid-clavicular   ‌ Mid-axillary  X ‌ Mid-scapular  ‌ Other:   Size:  ‌ 6Fr  ‌ 8Fr  ‌ 12FR  X ‌ 14Fr  ‌ 16Fr  ‌ 18Fr  ‌ 24Fr   ‌ 32 Fr  ‌ Other: Sutured: ‌X  Yes ‌ No   PROCEDURE FINDINGS: A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.   Fluid Removed: 1250_ ml ‌X  Serous  ‌ Serosanguinous ‌ Bloody  ‌ Chylous ‌ Other:   Pleural pressures:  If not measured, please check here ‌X Opening:   cmH20   500 ml:      cmH20   1000ml:     cmH20       1500ml:     cmH20   2000ml      cmH20.          Drainage device:   ‌X Pleurovac    ‌ Drainage Bag  ‌ Heimlich Valve  ‌ Pneumostat ‌ Other: Suction: ‌ X No ‌Yes, - ___ cmH20   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X ‌ Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   X ‌ Right ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ X None  ‌ Minimal ‌ Small  ‌ Moderate  ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌ Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ None  ‌Thin  ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X ‌ Normal  ‌ Diminished ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X  ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ Present  X‌ Absent Pleura: X ‌ Normal ‌ Thick  ‌ Nodular   SPECIMEN(S): ‌X  LDH                        X ‌Glucose    X   ‌T.

Stent in RML orifice in good position. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	2.3 mm	straight	Pulse effect 4	ablated
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 90% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

"DATE OF PROCEDURE: 12/16/2025   CC Referred Physician: Self, Referred No address on file   INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Elen Rogers is a 65 year old-year-old female who presents with Malignant Pleural Effusion. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Chest tube placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.   CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.   PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pleural Effusion (Malignant) POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above.   PROCEDURE:  76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation 32557 Insert catheter pleura with imaging (chest tube)   76604 was performed on the right side   ATTENDING:  John Smith, MD   ASSISTANT:   Mary Clark  MD   Support Staff: RN: Bedside RN   MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.   PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.   PATIENT POSITION: ‌ Supine  X ‌ Sitting   ‌ Lateral Decubitus: ‌ Right ‌ Left   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS:  X ‌ Image saved and up loaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   X ‌ Right ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ Minimal  ‌ Small ‌ X Moderate ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌X Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ X None  ‌Thin  ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: ‌ X Normal  ‌ Diminished;  ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ Present  X ‌ Absent Pleura:  ‌ Normal  ‌ Thick ‌ X Nodular   Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine 1%: 5__ ml     Other: ______ Entry Site: X ‌ Right 8__ Intercostal Space   ‌ Left ___ Intercostal Space ‌ Mid-clavicular   ‌ Mid-axillary  X ‌ Mid-scapular  ‌ Other:   Size:  ‌ 6Fr  ‌ 8Fr  X ‌ 12FR  ‌ 14Fr  ‌ 16Fr  ‌ 18Fr  ‌ 24Fr   ‌ 32 Fr  ‌ Other: Sutured: ‌X  Yes ‌ No   PROCEDURE FINDINGS: A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.   Fluid Removed: 450_ ml ‌  Serous  ‌ Serosanguinous X ‌ Bloody  ‌ Chylous ‌ Other:   Pleural pressures:  If not measured, please check here ‌X Opening:   cmH20   500 ml:      cmH20   1000ml:     cmH20       1500ml:     cmH20   2000ml      cmH20.          Drainage device:   ‌ Pleurovac    ‌ Drainage Bag  ‌ Heimlich Valve  X ‌ Pneumostat ‌ Other: Suction: ‌ X No ‌Yes, - ___ cmH20   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X ‌ Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   X ‌ Right ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ X Minimal ‌ Small  ‌ Moderate  ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌ X Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ X None  ‌Thin  ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X ‌ Normal  ‌ Diminished ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X  ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ Present  X‌ Absent Pleura: ‌ Normal ‌ Thick  X ‌ Nodular   SPECIMEN(S): ‌X  LDH                        X ‌Glucose    X   ‌T.

"DATE OF PROCEDURE: 12/16/2025   CC Referred Physician: Self, Referred No address on file   INDICATION FOR OPERATION: David Obasi is a 33 year old-year-old male who presents with Complex Parapneumonic Effusion. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Chest tube placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.   CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.   PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pleural Effusion (Suspected Empyema) POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above.   PROCEDURE:  76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation 32557 Insert catheter pleura with imaging (chest tube)   76604 was performed on the left side   ATTENDING:  John Smith, MD   ASSISTANT:   Mary Clark  MD   Support Staff: RN: Bedside RN   MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.   PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.   PATIENT POSITION: X ‌ Supine  ‌ Sitting   ‌ Lateral Decubitus: ‌ Right ‌ Left   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS:  X ‌ Image saved and up loaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   ‌ Right X ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ Minimal  ‌ Small ‌ X Moderate ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌ Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ X Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ None  ‌Thin  X ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: ‌ Normal  X ‌ Diminished;  ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ X Present  ‌ Absent Pleura:  ‌ Normal  X ‌ Thick ‌ Nodular   Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine 1%: 15__ ml     Other: ______ Entry Site: ‌ Right ___ Intercostal Space   X ‌ Left 4-5 Intercostal Space ‌ Mid-clavicular   X ‌ Mid-axillary  ‌ Mid-scapular  ‌ Other:   Size:  ‌ 6Fr  ‌ 8Fr  ‌ 12FR  ‌ 14Fr  ‌ 16Fr  ‌ 18Fr  X ‌ 24Fr   ‌ 32 Fr  ‌ Other: Sutured: ‌X  Yes ‌ No   PROCEDURE FINDINGS: A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.   Fluid Removed: 550_ ml ‌  Serous  ‌ Serosanguinous ‌ Bloody  ‌ Chylous X ‌ Other: Turbid/Purulent   Pleural pressures:  If not measured, please check here ‌X Opening:   cmH20   500 ml:      cmH20   1000ml:     cmH20       1500ml:     cmH20   2000ml      cmH20.          Drainage device:   ‌X Pleurovac    ‌ Drainage Bag  ‌ Heimlich Valve  ‌ Pneumostat ‌ Other: Suction: ‌ No X ‌Yes, - 20_ cmH20   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X ‌ Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   ‌ Right X ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ Minimal ‌ X Small  ‌ Moderate  ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌ Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ X Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ None  ‌ Thin  X ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: ‌ Normal  X ‌ Diminished ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X  ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ X Present  ‌ Absent Pleura: ‌ Normal  X‌ Thick  ‌ Nodular   SPECIMEN(S): ‌X  LDH                        X ‌Glucose    X   ‌T.

"DATE OF PROCEDURE: 12/16/2025   CC Referred Physician: Self, Referred No address on file   INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Linda Kim is a 81 year old-year-old female who presents with Large Pleural Effusion / CHF. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Chest tube placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.   CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.   PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pleural Effusion POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above.   PROCEDURE:  76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation 32557 Insert catheter pleura with imaging (chest tube)   76604 was performed on the right side   ATTENDING:  John Smith, MD   ASSISTANT:   Mary Clark  MD   Support Staff: RN: Bedside RN   MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.   PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.   PATIENT POSITION: X ‌ Supine  ‌ Sitting   ‌ Lateral Decubitus: ‌ Right ‌ Left   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS:  X ‌ Image saved and up loaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   X ‌ Right ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ Minimal  ‌ Small ‌ Moderate X ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌X Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ X None  ‌Thin  ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: ‌ Normal  X ‌ Diminished;  ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ X Present  ‌ Absent Pleura:  ‌ X Normal  ‌ Thick ‌ Nodular   Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine 1%: 10__ ml     Other: ______ Entry Site: X ‌ Right 6-7_ Intercostal Space   ‌ Left ___ Intercostal Space ‌ Mid-clavicular   X ‌ Mid-axillary  ‌ Mid-scapular  ‌ Other:   Size:  ‌ 6Fr  ‌ 8Fr  ‌ 12FR  X ‌ 14Fr  ‌ 16Fr  ‌ 18Fr  ‌ 24Fr   ‌ 32 Fr  ‌ Other: Sutured: ‌X  Yes ‌ No   PROCEDURE FINDINGS: A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.   Fluid Removed: 1850_ ml ‌X  Serous  ‌ Serosanguinous ‌ Bloody  ‌ Chylous ‌ Other:   Pleural pressures:  If not measured, please check here ‌X Opening:   cmH20   500 ml:      cmH20   1000ml:     cmH20       1500ml:     cmH20   2000ml      cmH20.          Drainage device:   ‌X Pleurovac    ‌ Drainage Bag  ‌ Heimlich Valve  ‌ Pneumostat ‌ Other: Suction: ‌ X No ‌Yes, - ___ cmH20   CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X ‌ Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:   X ‌ Right ‌ Left   Pleural Effusion: Volume:       ‌ None  ‌ X Minimal ‌ Small  ‌ Moderate  ‌ Large Echogenicity:   ‌ X Anechoic  ‌ Hypoechoic  ‌ Isoechoic ‌ Hyperechoic Loculations:  ‌ X None  ‌Thin  ‌ Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X ‌ Normal  ‌ Diminished ‌ Absent  Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:   X ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X  ‌ Present ‌ Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: ‌ Present  X‌ Absent Pleura: X ‌ Normal ‌ Thick  ‌ Nodular   SPECIMEN(S): ‌X  LDH                        X ‌Glucose    X   ‌T.

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Bronchus Intermedius .  Two areas were biopsied with NBI guidance.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Stents are in good position.  The (iCAST 7x16) was noted in the right lower airway.  (iCAST 5x16) was noted in the right middle lobe airway. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at RLL.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Balloon dilation was performed at RB2 orifice.  5mm mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 5mm at the RB2.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure (22 MODIFIER):
This patient required multiple forms of ablative therapy (soft coag and cryotherapy) to multiple different structures, including glottis, infraglottis, subglottis, and tracheal structures. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, Severity of patient's condition, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
 
ATTENDING:  Duane Johnson MD PhD
ASSISTANT:   none
 
Support Staff: 
RN: Maribel Dean
RT: Maribel Mosquera and Gene Smith
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Tracheoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  Sedation initiated.  LMA placed.
 
The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination.  Endobronchial topical lidocaine applied to the vocal cords and larynx.
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Vocal cords with appropriate adduction/abduction.
 
Large patch of papillomas at anterior commissure of larynx and right vocal cord.
 
Proximal trachea with focal area of spiraling tissue creating a focal area of mild stenosis - about 20% stenosis prior to treatment.  Able to easily traverse area of mild stenosis with therapeutic bronchoscope without issue.
 
Assessment of right airways revealed normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level.  Otherwise no evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
 
Assessment of left airways revealed normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology  
 
VC papilloma are treated with combination of cryospray, electro-cautery (PreciSect/softcoag), and mechanically debulking. 
 
Endobronchial papillomatous tumors at proximal trachea, subglottic region, infraglottic region, left vocal fold, and anterior commissure were treated with the following modalities. 
 
The base of all patch sites were treated with cryotherapy.
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryospray	2.3 mm catheter	Normal flow, Freeze	5 sec burst	Tumor frozen, 5 sites 3-5 treatment each
 
 
Endobronchial tumor and coagulated debris was noted and excised with mechanical debridement using alligator forceps. Send to path and microbiology.
 
Rigid tracheoscope was used to dilate the proximal tracheal obstruction.  Mechanically coring through the tumor.  Black non-ventilating scope was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 300 seconds each.
  
Cryospray was done at the tumor site proximal trachea for 2 different sites.  Total 3-5 treatments with 5 seconds of freeze at Normal flow was completed for both sides.   
 
Prior to treatment, proximal trachea airway was note to be 40% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
Throughout the procedure, careful attention was paid to suction any secretions and blood to prevent it falling into the distal trachea or more distal airways.
 
Residual secretions and blood were suctioned to clear.  Video imaging obtained and saved.  Bronchoscope removed.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient had airway device removed in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Trivial
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Trachea biopsy:  Pathology
 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Arvin T Hsu is a 49 year old-year-old adult who presents for bronchoscopy for blation of papillomatous tumors in the context of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
 
-Recommend repeat bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks to reassess recurrence of papillomas and consideration of additional treatment.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  Mohammad Alkrad is a 29 year old-year-old male who presents with tracheal stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ATTENDING:  
Dick Van Dyke MD
 
ASSISTANT:   Greg Trembley MD
 
Support Staff: 
RN: Camina Cabahug
RT: Frank Fellers
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Tracheal stent in place with slight granulation tissue and the anterior and posterior aspect of the proximal stent. Mild thick yellow mucus within the stent
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: As described above.  
 
GRANULATION TISSUE AT THE PROXIMAL STENT

 

 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
The 2.4mm cryoprobe was used to treat the anterior granulation tissue with 30 second freeze-thaw cycles (total of 4 cycles).
 
The granulation tissue at the posterior trachea was treated with the 2.4mm cryoprobe in which tissue was frozen to the probe and removed en bloc with the bronchoscope.
 
In sum, the granulation tissue at Subglottic was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryoprobe	2.4mm Cryoprobe	N/A	30 second freeze/thaw cycles	Excellent tissue destruction
 
Mild oozing/bleeding was noted and treated with cold saline.
 
Lastly, mucus/secretions were removed from within the stent using a combination of saline flushes and cytology brush.
 
AREAS OF GRANULATION  TISSUE TREATMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE

 
STENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE

 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--Tracheal tumor/granulation tissue removed with cryoprobe
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mohammad Alkrad is a 29 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of tracheal stenosis. Granulation tissue at the anterior and posterior aspects of the proximal tracheal stent were treated with cryoprobe with excellent tissue debulking.
 
--Post procedure CXR
--Follow up path results
--Patient to follow up in outpatient IP clinic to go over results and next steps

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Rigid Black ventilating scope was used to intubate the patient. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem  (100% obstruction) was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Knife 	PreciSect	10 secs	removed
Microwave	mini	90oC	2min, 1.5min	ablated
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 0% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LLL and LUL subsegments from mucus. 
 
The following stent (bonastent 10x20) was placed in the LLL basal subsegment to the LC2; jailing LB6 (origin of the tumor). 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Tumor from LMS

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a procedure when anatomy was challenging due to limited neck mobility. This made for a narrow window to perform the procedure and required four additional attending physicians to assist with the case. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, Severity of patient's condition, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31600 Incision of windpipe (perc trach).

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Neck Ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any abnormal vessel, mass, structures at the site of percutaneous tracheostomy.  There were no significant vessels/mass were noted overlying the tracheostomy site on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.  
 
The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.  The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.  Next, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  
 
There were issues with the ventilator, so manual bagging of the patient was performed. 
 
Lidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.  A 1 cm incision was made horizontally with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.  A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was then attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization.  This needle was removed and the 18 gauge introducer catheter over needle was then advanced into this position under direct visualization.   The inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place.  Next, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.  The site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.  
 
The 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level.  The White Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter until the positioning mark was visualized via the bronchoscope.  The White Rhino dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
 
Finally a Portex 7.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization.  The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were then removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place.  This was confirmed to be in good position bronchoscopically.  The Endotracheal tube was then removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube.   A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications. The staff physician was present throughout the entire procedure. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Andres Flores Luna is a 63 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure.

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	14	400	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), Cytology, and flow cytometry.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
Site 3: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
Site 4: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
Site 5: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

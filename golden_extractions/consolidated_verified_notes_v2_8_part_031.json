The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nConsent: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\nPostoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\n\nProcedure:\n\u2022 31624 Diagnostic bronchoscopy/lavage (BAL)\n\u2022 31628 Transbronchial biopsy single lobe\n\u2022 31629 TBNA single lobe\n\u2022 31627 Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted)\n\u2022 31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance\n\u2022 76377 3D rendering with interpretation and reporting of CT, US, Tomo modality (ION Planning Station)\n\u2022 77012 Radiology/radiologic guidance for CT guided needle placement (CIOS)\n\u2022 XU Unusual Non-Overlapping Service, the use of a service that is distinct because it does not overlap usual components of the main service\n\u2022 C7509 Diagnostic with cell washing(s) when performed, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7510 Bronchial alveolar lavage(s), with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7511 Single or multiple bronchial or endobronchial biopsy(ies), single or multiple sites, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\nAttending: Russell J. Miller, MD\nAnesthesia: General Anesthesia\nMonitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nInstrument:\n\u2022 Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\n\u2022 Ion Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nEstimated Blood Loss: Minimum\nComplications: None\n\nProcedure in Detail:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nThe therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\n\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\n\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.\n\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\n\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSpecimen(s):\n\u2022 TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology\n\nImpression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to PACU\n\u2022 Obtain chest X-ray\n\u2022 Discharge home once cleared by PACU\n\u2022 Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nRussell J.

Three thoracenteses with non-diagnostic cytology. Recent history of 20-pound weight loss and progressive dyspnea. PET-CT showing pleural thickening with moderate FDG uptake. Pleuroscopy for diagnosis.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Complete pre-procedure assessment\n- Informed consent with detailed risk discussion\n- Patient NPO since midnight\n- Timeout performed\n- CT chest reviewed: Large left effusion with enhancing pleura, no obvious mass\n- PET-CT: Diffuse pleural uptake, SUV max 5.4\n- Labs: WBC 8.9K, Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, Platelets 342K, PT/INR normal, Creatinine 1.0\n- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm\n- Vital signs: BP 142/86, HR 76, SpO2 92% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\n- Monitored anesthesia care\n- Propofol infusion with midazolam premedication\n- Fentanyl for analgesia\n- Spontaneous ventilation maintained\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Right lateral decubitus position\n- Left hemithorax uppermost\n- Appropriate padding and positioning\n- Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitoring, blood pressure monitoring\n\n*Access:*\n- Point-of-care ultrasound performed\n- Left lateral chest, 7th intercostal space, mid-axillary line selected\n- Chlorhexidine prep with sterile technique\n- Local anesthesia: 20 mL 1% lidocaine\n- 10 mm skin incision\n- Blunt dissection through intercostal space\n- Pleural space entered\n- Initial pleural fluid: 500 mL turbid yellow fluid drained\n- 10 mm trocar placed\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid pleuroscope (7 mm, 0-degree) inserted\n- Systematic survey of pleural cavity\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Diffuse pleural thickening with irregular, nodular surface. White-yellow plaques visible. Areas of pleural fibrosis.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Marked thickening (up to 1 cm estimated) with diffuse nodular changes. Cobblestone appearance in areas. No discrete masses but confluent involvement.\n- **Diaphragm:** Diaphragmatic pleura significantly thickened and irregular\n- **Lung:** Lung expansion limited due to visceral pleural involvement (trapped lung)\n- **Overall Impression:** Diffuse pleural thickening and nodularity highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- Multiple deep pleural biopsies from parietal pleura (10 specimens)\n- Biopsies included pleural tissue and underlying muscle\n- Rigid forceps used for adequate tissue samples\n- 3 biopsies from visceral pleura (limited by trapped lung)\n- Additional biopsy sent for special studies (electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry)\n- Hemostasis confirmed after each biopsy\n\n*Therapeutic Consideration:*\n- Due to trapped lung physiology, pleurodesis not performed\n- Would be ineffective given inability of lung to expand\n- Complete drainage: total 1,350 mL turbid fluid\n- 24 French chest tube placed under direct visualization\n- Tube positioned for optimal drainage\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient stable, transferred to recovery\n- Chest tube to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: chest tube in place, trapped lung confirmed with inability to expand to chest wall, no pneumothorax\n- Patient breathing comfortably\n- Vital signs: BP 136/82, HR 78, SpO2 95% on 2L NC\n- Pain controlled (3/10 with IV medications)\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (13 specimens) - histopathology\n- Tissue for immunohistochemistry (mesothelioma panel)\n- Tissue for electron microscopy\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, cell count, chemistry\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy with findings highly suspicious for malignant pleural mesothelioma. Trapped lung physiology identified. Adequate tissue obtained for comprehensive diagnosis including special studies.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DISPOSITION:** \nAdmitted for chest tube management and pathology results\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube to water seal, monitor drainage\n- Serial chest X-rays\n- Pathology expected in 5-7 days (including special studies)\n- Thoracic oncology consultation\n- Occupational medicine referral for asbestos exposure history\n- Given trapped lung, will likely require indwelling pleural catheter for long-term management\n- Remove chest tube when output minimal and patient comfortable\n- Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion once pathology confirmed\n- Discuss treatment options (chemotherapy, radiation, clinical trials) per oncology\n- Consider palliative care involvement\n- Follow up in clinic 1 week post-discharge",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: Maria Rodriguez, 38-year-old Female\nMRN: 6905843\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Rodriguez is a 38-year-old female with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis presenting with progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia refractory to medical management. PFTs show restrictive pattern with DLCO 45% predicted. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to whole lung lavage were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)\nATTENDING: Dr. Richard Brown\nASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Daniel Martinez\nRT: Sarah Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus\nThe patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.\nThe bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.\nLavage Procedure:\nThe patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37\u00b0C) 0.9% normal saline.\nSerial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:\n\nAliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment\nAliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment\nAliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid\nAliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid\nAliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid\nAliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear\n\nTotal volume instilled: 6000mL\nTotal volume returned: 5820mL\nNet balance: -180mL (absorbed)\nThe effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.\nAfter completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT position was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nLavage fluid (first aliquot) sent for cell count, cytology, and periodic acid-Schiff staining\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Rodriguez underwent successful whole lung lavage of the left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Procedure completed without complications. Patient will undergo right lung lavage in 4-6 weeks pending clinical response. Post-procedure CXR shows expected mild bilateral infiltrates, no pneumothorax. Plan for 6-minute walk test and PFTs in 4 weeks to assess response. GM-CSF therapy to be discussed with pulmonology.",

    "note_text": "Patient: Brian Foster\nMRN: 6927483\nDate of Procedure: December 7, 2016\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy\n\nSurgeon: Daniel Carter, MD\nAssistant: Monica Taylor, MD\nIndications: Left mainstem obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nOn initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.\n\nAt this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.\n\nSubsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Await tissue diagnosis\n\u2022 ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung\n\u2022 If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent\n\nDaniel Carter, MD\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: James Wilson, 45-year-old Male\nMRN: 5894732\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Wilson is a 45-year-old male admitted 18 days ago with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patient remains ventilator-dependent with anticipated prolonged intubation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to percutaneous tracheostomy were discussed with the patient's wife (patient sedated). Surrogate indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was obtained.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prolonged mechanical ventilation; ARDS\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Tracheostomy, Planned (Percutaneous, Bronchoscopic Assistance) (CPT 31600)\nATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor\nASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Amanda White\nRT: Christopher Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)\nMONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.\nWith bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nA syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.\nThe inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.\nThe Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.\nFinally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.\nThe endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S): None\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Wilson underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance. Procedure performed without complications. CXR post-procedure shows appropriate positioning without pneumothorax. Continue mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Tracheostomy care per protocol. Follow up with ICU team for ongoing management.",

Initial Airway Inspection\n\nFindings:\n\u2022 The flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the 8.5 ETT and advanced into the trachea\n\u2022 The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina\n\u2022 The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level\n\u2022 Inspection notable for an endobronchial fungating mass in the RUL obstructing the superior and anterior segments\n\u2022 The remaining airways appeared normal with no additional endobronchial abnormalities, mucosal irregularities, or abnormal secretions\n\nII. Tissue Sampling Procedures\n\nA. Right Upper Lobe (RUL) Endobronchial Biopsy\n\u2022 An endobronchial mass was identified obstructing the superior and anterior segments of the RUL\n\u2022 Sampling Techniques:\n  - Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex transbronchial needle with five (5) passes\n  - Endobronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with six (6) samples obtained\n  - Hemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine\n\nB. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Lesion Biopsy\n\u2022 A second lesion was identified in the superior segment of the LLL using radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a concentric view\n\u2022 Sampling Techniques:\n  - Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex with four (4) passes\n  - Transbronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with five (5) samples obtained\n  - Hemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine\n\nC. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) - Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Superior Segment\n\u2022 A BAL was performed in the superior segment of the left lower lobe\n\u2022 Instillation: 110 cc normal saline\n\u2022 Return: 20 cc\n\u2022 Samples sent for cytology, microbiology (bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures), and differential cell count\n\nD. Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE)\n\u2022 Right Upper Lobe (RUL) lesion: ROSE interpretation was malignant\n\u2022 Left Lower Lobe (LLL) lesion: ROSE revealed abundant necrosis but pathology was unable to definitively confirm malignancy\n\nIII. Final Airway Re-Inspection and Conclusion\n\nFindings:\n\u2022 No active bleeding was noted on final airway inspection\n\u2022 No evidence of airway compromise\n\nEstimated Blood Loss: Moderate, successfully controlled with topical epinephrine\nComplications: No immediate complications\n\nDisposition/Plan:\n\u2022 The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition\n\u2022 Post-procedure CXR was performed to rule out pneumothorax or other complications\n\u2022 Pathology, cytology, and microbiology results are pending\n\u2022 Follow-up bronchoscopy and multidisciplinary evaluation will be planned based on final pathology results\n\nAttending: Amanda Rodriguez, MD\nInterventional Pulmonary and Critical Care\nNaval Medical Center San Diego\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: Douglas Diaz\nMRN: 6184729\nDate of Procedure: February 11, 2025\n\nIndication for Operation: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a right upper lobe (RUL) nodule. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nConsent: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\nPostoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\n\nProcedure:\n\u2022 31624 Diagnostic bronchoscopy/lavage (BAL)\n\u2022 31628 Transbronchial biopsy single lobe\n\u2022 31629 TBNA single lobe\n\u2022 31627 Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted)\n\u2022 31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance\n\u2022 76377 3D rendering with interpretation and reporting of CT, US, Tomo modality (ION Planning Station)\n\u2022 77012 Radiology/radiologic guidance for CT guided needle placement (CIOS)\n\u2022 XU Unusual Non-Overlapping Service, the use of a service that is distinct because it does not overlap usual components of the main service\n\u2022 C7509 Diagnostic with cell washing(s) when performed, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7510 Bronchial alveolar lavage(s), with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7511 Single or multiple bronchial or endobronchial biopsy(ies), single or multiple sites, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\nAttending: Russell J. Miller, MD\nAnesthesia: General Anesthesia\nMonitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nInstrument:\n\u2022 Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\n\u2022 Ion Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nEstimated Blood Loss: Minimum\nComplications: None\n\nProcedure in Detail:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nThe therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\n\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\n\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.\n\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\n\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSpecimen(s):\n\u2022 TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology\n\nImpression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to PACU\n\u2022 Obtain chest X-ray\n\u2022 Discharge home once cleared by PACU\n\u2022 Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nRussell J. Miller, MD\nFebruary 11, 2025\n\n________________________________________",

Three thoracenteses with non-diagnostic cytology. Recent history of 20-pound weight loss and progressive dyspnea. PET-CT showing pleural thickening with moderate FDG uptake. Pleuroscopy for diagnosis.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Complete pre-procedure assessment\n- Informed consent with detailed risk discussion\n- Patient NPO since midnight\n- Timeout performed\n- CT chest reviewed: Large left effusion with enhancing pleura, no obvious mass\n- PET-CT: Diffuse pleural uptake, SUV max 5.4\n- Labs: WBC 8.9K, Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, Platelets 342K, PT/INR normal, Creatinine 1.0\n- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm\n- Vital signs: BP 142/86, HR 76, SpO2 92% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\n- Monitored anesthesia care\n- Propofol infusion with midazolam premedication\n- Fentanyl for analgesia\n- Spontaneous ventilation maintained\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Right lateral decubitus position\n- Left hemithorax uppermost\n- Appropriate padding and positioning\n- Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitoring, blood pressure monitoring\n\n*Access:*\n- Point-of-care ultrasound performed\n- Left lateral chest, 7th intercostal space, mid-axillary line selected\n- Chlorhexidine prep with sterile technique\n- Local anesthesia: 20 mL 1% lidocaine\n- 10 mm skin incision\n- Blunt dissection through intercostal space\n- Pleural space entered\n- Initial pleural fluid: 500 mL turbid yellow fluid drained\n- 10 mm trocar placed\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid pleuroscope (7 mm, 0-degree) inserted\n- Systematic survey of pleural cavity\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Diffuse pleural thickening with irregular, nodular surface. White-yellow plaques visible. Areas of pleural fibrosis.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Marked thickening (up to 1 cm estimated) with diffuse nodular changes. Cobblestone appearance in areas. No discrete masses but confluent involvement.\n- **Diaphragm:** Diaphragmatic pleura significantly thickened and irregular\n- **Lung:** Lung expansion limited due to visceral pleural involvement (trapped lung)\n- **Overall Impression:** Diffuse pleural thickening and nodularity highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- Multiple deep pleural biopsies from parietal pleura (10 specimens)\n- Biopsies included pleural tissue and underlying muscle\n- Rigid forceps used for adequate tissue samples\n- 3 biopsies from visceral pleura (limited by trapped lung)\n- Additional biopsy sent for special studies (electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry)\n- Hemostasis confirmed after each biopsy\n\n*Therapeutic Consideration:*\n- Due to trapped lung physiology, pleurodesis not performed\n- Would be ineffective given inability of lung to expand\n- Complete drainage: total 1,350 mL turbid fluid\n- 24 French chest tube placed under direct visualization\n- Tube positioned for optimal drainage\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient stable, transferred to recovery\n- Chest tube to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: chest tube in place, trapped lung confirmed with inability to expand to chest wall, no pneumothorax\n- Patient breathing comfortably\n- Vital signs: BP 136/82, HR 78, SpO2 95% on 2L NC\n- Pain controlled (3/10 with IV medications)\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (13 specimens) - histopathology\n- Tissue for immunohistochemistry (mesothelioma panel)\n- Tissue for electron microscopy\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, cell count, chemistry\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy with findings highly suspicious for malignant pleural mesothelioma. Trapped lung physiology identified. Adequate tissue obtained for comprehensive diagnosis including special studies.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DISPOSITION:** \nAdmitted for chest tube management and pathology results\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube to water seal, monitor drainage\n- Serial chest X-rays\n- Pathology expected in 5-7 days (including special studies)\n- Thoracic oncology consultation\n- Occupational medicine referral for asbestos exposure history\n- Given trapped lung, will likely require indwelling pleural catheter for long-term management\n- Remove chest tube when output minimal and patient comfortable\n- Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion once pathology confirmed\n- Discuss treatment options (chemotherapy, radiation, clinical trials) per oncology\n- Consider palliative care involvement\n- Follow up in clinic 1 week post-discharge",

    "note_text": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer with TR fistula and endobronchial invasion. \nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, endobronchial biopsy, tumor debulking, and Silicone Y-stent placement\nINDICATIONS: Extrinsic airway compression and suspected TE fistula.\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The right vocal cord was irregular appearing with small vocal cord nodule visualized.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal with the exception of some mild mucosal irregularity in distal 2cm of the posterior tracheal wall. Thick purulent material was seen pulling at the level of the carina and the proximal left mainstem. After clearing secretions a endobronchial mass which appeared to extend from the esophagus was visualized within the proximal left mainstem causing about 80% endobronchial obstruction.  Just proximal to that mass was a small area where GI contents could be seen entering the airway consistent with a small TE fistula.  This was only about 1-2 mm distal to the main carina.  After bypassing the main tumor within the proximal left mainstem which was about 1 cm in depth submucosal infiltration could be seen for approximately 4 cm within the left mainstem bronchi.  There were purulent thick secretions throughout the left-sided airways which were suctioned via trap and sent for culture.  The right mainstem was significantly obstructed (approximately 70%) extrinsically with the greatest degree obstruction just proximal to the right upper lobe takeoff.  The bronchus intermedius appeared uninvolved and was widely patent.  The right middle lobe was normal to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  In the proximal aspect of the right lower lobe was some black discoloration of the mucosa but did not appear to be malignant and there is no endobronchial disease or obstruction to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  \nFollowing inspection the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced to the distal trachea and connected to the Jet ventilator.  The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. Forcep biopsies were taken of the proximal left mainstem mass.  Moderate bleeding was encountered which was treated with topical epinephrine.  After adequate samples were taken APC was used to burn and shave the lesion using the tip of the bronchoscope to remove the devascularized tissue as well as forceps to remove associated debris.  After debulking the left mainstem was approximately 90% patent throughout.  Due to the carinal involvement with fistulization as well as the right mainstem extrinsic obstruction decision was made to place a silicone Y stent into the airway. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 40mm in the tracheal limb, 25mm in the right mainstem limb and 45mm in the left mainstem limb.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and we initially attempted to insert the stent using Freitag forceps with indirect laryngoscopy.  This was unsuccessful and at one point the stent was deployed within the proximal esophagus.  The LMA was removed at that point and an endotracheal tube inserted after which we navigated into the proximal esophagus with the flexible bronchoscope, identified the stent and removed with flexible forceps.  After aborting attempts at Freitag placement a 14 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the airway for dimensional stent deployment.  The Rigid bronchoscope was then advanced to the proximal right mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The Stent was well seated. The trachea and left mainstem were widely patent and the area of disease mucosa within the left mainstem was completely covered.  The right mainstem only improved in diameter to approximately 50% of normal due to continued extrinsic compression on the stent from her esophageal mass. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed.  After removal of the bronchoscope it was noted that the patient had a small laceration on her tongue which developed during the procedure.\nComplications: Small tongue laceration\nEstimated blood loss: 10 cc\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer PACU\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- ENT consult to evaluate tongue laceration\n- Patient will transfer back to the VA once PACU discharge criteria are met.  \n- Nebulized hypertonic (3%) saline 3 cc mixed with 2 cc of albuterol TID for stent maintenance and clearance of secretions.  Patient will need to have a home nebulizer arranged prior to discharge to home.\n- Patient to follow-up in the interventional pulmonary clinic in one month or earlier if any issues develop which require earlier evaluation.",

The trachea was normal. On the right there was a small focus of tumor just prximal to the right upper lobe at the anterior wall which was non-obstructive. The right sided airways were otherwise normal. The left mainstem was normal.  At the takeoff of the left lower lobe there was a vascular appearing endobronchial mass causing complete airway obstruction. At the takeoff of the left upper lobe there was a similar appearing vascular endobronchial lesion causing complete airway obstruction. With gentile manipulation of the tumor it was noted to bleed easily. APC was used to devascularize the superficial layer of the left upper and lower lobe tumors.  The electrocautery snare was then used to remove the prximal portion of the left upper lobe tumor after which we cold visualize distal airways. The tumor extended to just proximal to the lingual take-off and distally there did not appear to be evidence of active tumor.  Using APC we used the burn and shave method to slowly debulk the tumor as well as flexible forceps debulking of charred tumor after APC cauterization. Bleeding was moderate and resolved with topical instillation of 1:1000 TXA through the bronchoscope. After debulking in the left upper lobe we had complete opening of the lobar and segmental bronchi. We then brought our attention to the left lower lobe lesion. Using the electrocautery snare in a similar fashion we were able to debulk the proximal tumor. There was much more extensive distal tumor in the lower lobe with tumor involving multiple segmental bronchi. Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract some of the tissue after which we utilized APC and flexible forceps in a similar fashion as performed in the left upper lobe to slowly debulk the tumor. We were able to open the left lower lobe orifice to approximately 70% of normal but despite our best efforts we could not completely remove the tumor due to the extent of disease and distal tumor infiltration. APC was used at the end of the procedure to paint cauterize any active oozing and once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer patient PACU\n-\tFollow-up PRN if return of symptoms\n-\tTreatment of metastatic foci per oncology",

The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the posterior oropharynx. The ETT was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. Airway inspection was performed and the tracheal and right sided airways were normal. At the proximal aspect of the left mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing complete obstruction of the airway. Using the 2.4 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract portions of the tumor slowly and further extraction was performed using utilized APC and flexible forceps to \u201cburn and shave\u201d the remaining until eventually the LC1 carina was seen. In the left upper lobe the airways appeared normal without evidence of tumor while in the left lower lobe mucosal tumor invasion was present but non-obstructive to at least the first subsegments. Although we were able to debulk the majority of tumor in the mainstem there remained significant residual tumor burden causing partial airway obstruction and it was decided to place and Aero SEMS to maintain patency and for barrier effect. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope into the left lower lobe past the mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted and the stent was evaluated and was in appropriate position with a residual airway of >90% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and bronchoscopic intubation was performed with an 8.0 ETT and the procedure was completed.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.",

    "note_text": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer with tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n1.\tExtensive tumor infiltration within the bronchus intermedius extending into the right lower lobe as well as less extensive tumor infiltration in the right upper lobe.\n2.\tPost-obstructive pneumonia\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy\nINDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  \nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the flexible bronchoscope was inserted into the posterior oropharynx via an LMA. The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the distal right mainstem completely obstructive tumor and mucous was seen. The mucous was suctioned and tumor obstructive tumor was visualized in the proximal BI just below the right upper lobe. There was yellow plaques through the right mainstem extending into the right upper lobe with an appearance consistent with radiation bronchitis. Within the right upper lobe there was a combination of tumor and radiation bronchitis resulting in occlusion of the apical and anterior segments and about 80% obstruction of the posterior segment. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we identified a small orifice in the tumor within the bronchus intermedius which had a stricture like appearance. The electrocautery knife was used to make radial incisions after which large volume of pus was expressed for the distal airways. A trap was placed and the purulent material was suctioned and collected for culture. We were unable to pass the thin bronchoscope through the orifice or insert a CRE balloon due to the size.    We then began to slowly debulk the endobronchial tumor through the use of a combination of APC, and forceps. We continued to debulk the tumor and utilizing an 6-7-8 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 70% recanalization of the proximal and mid broncus intermedius and the proximal right lower lobe orifice. A small opening was identified leading to the distal BI where we could see the orifice of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe however there was extensive tumor infiltration which continued into the lobar bronchi. The right middle lobe orifice was also encased with extensive tumor and we could only achieve about 10% recanalization. Infiltrating friable areas of tumor were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Due to the extent of tumor within the distal airways we did not believe that airway stent placement would be appropriate as distal tumor ingrowth would likely occur. We then addressed the right upper lobe where we were able to gently debulk tumor with APC and flexible forceps to where the apical and anterior segments (which were anatomically fused could be identified. Utilizing a 6-7-8 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 85% recanalization of the anterior apical and posterior segmental orifices.  Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nWe expect the obstruction to recur due to the extent of tumor involvement. \nPatient likely is not a candidate for additional radiation therapy given the apparent radiation bronchitis. Will need to discuss options with medical oncologist \nPatient was given a 10 day course of Augmentin due to the extensive post-obstructive pneumonia which was discovered and evacuated during bronchoscopy\nWill obtain repeat CT of the chest for assessment of distal airways post-procedure.",

    "note_text": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer with tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant intrinsic airway obstruction\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial dubulking\nINDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  \nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia a 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung and right upper lobe appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right upper lobe there was mucosal tumor infiltration causing partial (about 30% obstruction of the lobe). Just distal to the right upper lobe orifice in the bronchus intermedius there was a large polypoid tumor with base on the lateral wall causing complete airway obstruction.  At this point the flexible forceps were used to take tissue samples for pathological evaluation.  We then attempted to secure the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare however were unable to get the snare to wrap around the distal aspect and this was subsequently aborted. We then used the ND-YAG  began to slowly devascularize. After which the rigid optic was reinserted and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced to the level of the lesion and using an apple coring technique with the bevel of the rigid bronchoscope we were able to cut through stock of the lesion. We then reinserted the flexible bronchoscope and using suction were able to secure the free lesion and remove en-block with suction. After this the airway was essentially open however there was significant residual mucosal tumor at the base and extending to the level of the basilar branches of the right lower lobe obstructing both the middle lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe. The middle lobe and superior segment were found and opened to approximately 50% of normal diameter.  APC was used to debulk the residual tumor using a burn and shave technique as well as flexible forceps to remove coagulated debris. We were able to achieve approximately 85% recanalization of the proximal bronchus intermedius, and 60% of the distal BI. A similar technique was then used to remove the mucosal infiltrating tumor at the orifice of the right upper lobe with end result approximately 80% recanalization. Placement of a stent to prevent re-ingrowth was considered however based on the patient\u2019s wishes (to avoid stent unless absolutely necessary) as well as the need to likely \u201cjail\u201d the right middle lobe and superior segment with the stent we decided to forgo this intervention and see how patient responds both clinically and to any possible systemic therapy which might prevent recurrence. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nAwait tissue diagnosis for confirmation of recurrence \nObtain CXR in PACU.\nWe expect the obstruction to recur without systemic treatment and possibly radiation due to the extent of tumor involvement. Will discuss with patients primary oncologist regarding options for systemic therapy.",

CXR shows hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift. CT chest confirms suspected foreign body in right mainstem bronchus. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal were discussed with the patient's parents in detail. Parents indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration, right mainstem bronchus\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration (peanut fragment), right mainstem bronchus\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Foreign Body Removal\nATTENDING: Dr. Steven Martinez\nASSISTANT: Dr. Laura White, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Katherine Brown\nRT: Andrew Garcia\nAnesthesia: Dr. Michelle Chen\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended\nA 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.\nInitial Survey:\n\nLarynx: Normal\nVocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement\nTrachea: Normal caliber, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\n\nThe bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.\nForeign Body Retrieval:\nOptical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.\nThe foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.\nThe bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:\n\nRight mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material\nRight upper lobe: Patent\nRight middle lobe: Patent\nRight lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions\nLeft lung: Examined and found to be normal\n\nSecretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was identified. Final inspection showed:\n\nComplete foreign body removal\nMild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding\nPatent bilateral airways\n\nThe bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.\nThe attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nForeign body: Peanut fragment (retained for documentation)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Emma underwent successful rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal. A peanut fragment was removed from the right mainstem bronchus without complication. Post-procedure CXR ordered to confirm resolution of hyperinflation. Observe overnight with monitoring. Discharge tomorrow if stable. No bronchodilators needed. Counsel parents on choking prevention. Follow up with pediatrician in 1 week.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without any endoluminal obstruction. On the right, there was minimal structuring of the bronchus intermedius. On the left, the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially, and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded.\n\nRadial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation. However, due to the proximal obstruction, dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a guide wire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point, we performed APC to the left mainstem followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly recanalize the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly reopened, but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets. However, once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem, a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2 mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture.\n\nAt this point, to protect from major vascular bleeding, we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem, after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax. In the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation, we felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area, a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Patient to remain intubated tonight\n\u2022 CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung\n\u2022 Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery\n\u2022 Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight, place left side down, intubate right mainstem, call me (602-791-3135) and pediatric surgeon immediately\n\u2022 We will continue to follow\n\nKevin Martinez, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Exudative by Light's criteria. Two negative cytologies. CT findings suggestive of pleural disease but no definitive mass. Pleuroscopy for tissue diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Pre-procedure evaluation completed\n- Informed consent obtained, patient understands risks including bleeding, infection, need for chest tube, respiratory failure\n- Goals of care discussed\n- Timeout performed with all team members\n- CT chest: Moderate right pleural effusion with subtle pleural thickening\n- Prior thoracentesis results reviewed: exudative, negative cytology x2, pH 7.35\n- Labs: WBC 7.1K, Hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, Platelets 256K, INR 1.0, Creatinine 0.8\n- Vital signs: BP 134/78, HR 82, SpO2 94% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\n- Monitored anesthesia care\n- Propofol infusion (total 420 mg)\n- Fentanyl 100 mcg IV\n- Midazolam 2 mg IV for anxiolysis\n- Patient maintained adequate spontaneous respiration\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Left lateral decubitus position\n- Right side up\n- Appropriate positioning with pillows and padding\n- Standard ASA monitoring\n\n*Access:*\n- Ultrasound-guided site selection\n- Right lateral chest, 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line\n- Betadine followed by chlorhexidine skin prep\n- Local anesthesia: 18 mL 1% lidocaine\n- 10 mm incision with #15 blade\n- Blunt dissection using Kelly clamp technique\n- Pleural space identified\n- 700 mL clear yellow fluid initially evacuated\n- 10 mm trocar inserted without difficulty\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid pleuroscope (7 mm, 0-degree) introduced\n- Comprehensive pleural examination performed\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Scattered small white nodules (2-5 mm) over visceral surface, estimated 15-20 lesions total. Intervening normal appearing pleura.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Several larger nodular lesions (8-12 mm) on posterolateral parietal pleura. Approximately 6-8 distinct nodules identified. Areas of pleural inflammation surrounding nodules.\n- **Diaphragm:** 2-3 small nodules on diaphragmatic surface\n- **Lung:** Adequate lung expansion, no evidence of trapped lung\n- **Overall Impression:** Multifocal pleural nodules concerning for metastatic disease vs lymphoma\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- 6 targeted biopsies from parietal pleural nodules (largest lesions)\n- 4 biopsies from visceral pleural nodules\n- Adequate tissue obtained with optical forceps\n- Good hemostasis after each biopsy\n- Specimens appropriately labeled\n- Additional tissue sent for flow cytometry (concern for lymphoma)\n\n*Therapeutic Intervention:*\n- Given good lung expansion and possibility of malignancy, decision made to proceed with talc pleurodesis\n- Complete fluid drainage: total 1,250 mL\n- 5 grams sterile graded talc insufflated\n- Talc distributed evenly throughout pleural space under direct visualization\n- Attention paid to coating all surfaces\n- 28 French chest tube placed under direct vision\n- Chest tube appropriately positioned\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient transferred to PACU in stable condition\n- Chest tube connected to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure portable chest X-ray: chest tube well positioned, talc visible throughout right hemithorax, minimal residual effusion, no pneumothorax\n- Patient awake, alert, comfortable\n- Vital signs: BP 128/74, HR 78, SpO2 96% on 2L NC\n- Pain score 2/10 with IV medications\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (10 specimens) - histopathology\n- Fresh tissue - flow cytometry\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, flow cytometry, cell count\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy revealing multifocal pleural nodules suspicious for metastatic disease or lymphoma. Talc pleurodesis performed given adequate lung expansion. Comprehensive tissue sampling obtained for diagnosis including flow cytometry.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DISPOSITION:** \nAdmitted to general medical floor for post-procedure care\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube management: water seal after 24 hours if output appropriate\n- Monitor for post-pleurodesis fever (expected and benign)\n- Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h scheduled\n- Ibuprofen 600 mg q8h PRN\n- Opioid pain management as needed\n- Daily chest X-rays\n- Remove chest tube when: output <150 mL/24h, no air leak, lung expanded\n- Anticipated chest tube duration: 2-4 days\n- Await pathology and flow cytometry (3-5 days)\n- Hematology/oncology consultation pending diagnosis\n- Follow up in clinic 2 weeks post-discharge with imaging\n- Repeat chest X-ray 6 weeks to assess pleurodesis efficacy",

Patient is not a surgical candidate due to severe COPD (FEV1 0.9L, 32% predicted). PET SUV 8.2. Referred for bronchoscopic thermal ablation.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma, peripheral\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\n\nPROCEDURE: Bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation, radial EBUS confirmation, and microwave ablation of RLL nodule\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (8.0 ETT)\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitors, arterial line\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nAfter timeout and induction of general anesthesia, flexible bronchoscopy was performed through the ETT. Airways were inspected and found to be patent without endobronchial lesions. \n\nElectromagnetic navigation (superDimension system) was utilized to navigate to the RB6 segment. Registration error: 2.8mm. Target reached notification confirmed.\n\nRadial EBUS (1.4mm probe) was advanced through the extended working channel. Concentric view obtained confirming tool-in-lesion position. Lesion measured 23mm on radial EBUS.\n\nCone-beam CT was performed confirming catheter tip within the lesion with adequate margins.\n\nMicrowave ablation probe (Neuwave Emprint, 15cm, 2.0cm antenna) was advanced to the target. Ablation performed:\n- Power: 100W\n- Duration: 10 minutes\n- Target temperature achieved: 180\u00b0C\n- Ablation zone confirmed on post-ablation CBCT: 3.2cm sphere\n\nPost-ablation inspection showed no bleeding or airway injury. The patient was extubated without difficulty.\n\nSPECIMENS: None (ablation only, prior biopsy confirmed diagnosis)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nEBL: Minimal (<5mL)\n\nIMPRESSION: Successful microwave ablation of 2.4cm RLL squamous cell carcinoma. Adequate ablation zone achieved with margins.\n\nPLAN:\n- Post-procedure CXR: No pneumothorax\n- Admit for overnight observation\n- CT chest in 1 month for treatment response\n- Tumor board discussion for any additional therapy\n- Follow-up in IP clinic 2 weeks\n\nDr. Jennifer Walsh, MD\nAttending Interventional Pulmonologist",

CT shows near-complete obstruction of LMS. Palliative debulking requested.\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Metastatic RCC with LMS bronchus obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Same\n\nProcedures:\n1. Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) of endobronchial tumor\n3. Mechanical debulking\n4. Balloon dilation of LMS stenosis\n5. Therapeutic aspiration\n\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia, jet ventilation through rigid bronchoscope\n\nProcedure Details:\nAfter induction and timeout, rigid bronchoscope (Efer-Dumon 13.5mm) inserted. Inspection revealed hemorrhagic, friable tumor mass nearly occluding the LMS bronchus with approximately 90% obstruction. Tumor extended from 1cm below the main carina to the LUL takeoff.\n\nAPC (ERBE VIO, 60W, Flow 2.0 L/min) applied in pulsed mode to devascularize tumor surface. Excellent coagulation achieved with reduced bleeding during subsequent debulking.\n\nMechanical debulking performed using rigid coring technique and large biopsy forceps. Substantial tumor volume removed. Multiple specimens sent for pathology confirmation.\n\nAfter tumor removal, residual stenosis noted. Balloon dilation (CRE 15-18mm) performed at 8 ATM x 60 seconds x 2 inflations. Good expansion achieved.\n\nTherapeutic aspiration of copious post-obstructive secretions (~50mL purulent material).\n\nFinal inspection: LMS now 70% patent (post-obstruction reduced to 30%). LUL and LLL orifices visualized. Improved airflow noted.\n\nComplications: Moderate bleeding controlled with APC\nEBL: 75mL\n\nSpecimens: Endobronchial tumor tissue x 6 to surgical pathology\n\nPost-Procedure:\n- Stridor resolved\n- SpO2 improved from 88% to 96% on 2L NC\n- CXR: Improved LUL aeration, no pneumothorax\n- Admit to stepdown for overnight monitoring\n\nPlan:\n- Repeat bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks\n- Palliative radiation oncology consult\n- Continue supportive care\n\nL.

Anti-GM-CSF antibody positive (autoimmune PAP). Progressive dyspnea despite GM-CSF therapy. Current PFTs: FVC 2.1L (58% pred), DLCO 45% pred. 6MWT: 280m with desaturation to 82%. CT shows diffuse ground-glass opacities bilaterally with \"crazy-paving\" pattern. Referred for therapeutic whole lung lavage.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, autoimmune\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\n\nPROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage - Left lung\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\n\nAirway Management:\nPatient brought to OR, standard monitors placed. Pre-oxygenation with 100% FiO2 x 5 minutes. Induction with propofol 150mg IV, fentanyl 100mcg IV, rocuronium 50mg IV. Direct laryngoscopy performed. Left-sided 37Fr double-lumen tube (Mallinckrodt) placed and position confirmed with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Bronchial cuff in left mainstem, tracheal cuff above carina. Both lumens patent and functional.\n\nLung Isolation:\nLeft lung isolated. Lung separation confirmed by auscultation and bronchoscopy. Right lung ventilated with TV 400mL, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. SpO2 maintained 94-98% on single lung ventilation.\n\nLavage Procedure - Left Lung:\nWarmed sterile normal saline (37\u00b0C) used for lavage. Aliquots of 1000mL instilled via gravity drainage through left bronchial lumen.\n\nLavage Summary:\n- Total saline instilled: 18.5 liters\n- Total fluid returned: 17.2 liters (93% return)\n- Number of cycles: 18\n- Initial effluent: Grossly milky/opaque\n- Final effluent: Near-clear (cycle 16-18)\n- Duration of lavage: 4 hours 15 minutes\n\nEach cycle:\n1. Instill 1000mL saline over 2-3 minutes\n2. Allow 3-5 minute dwell time with gentle chest percussion\n3. Drain by gravity and gentle suction\n4. Monitor SpO2 (maintained >90% throughout)\n\nComplications during lavage:\n- Transient desaturation to 88% during cycle 12 (resolved with increased FiO2 and brief pause)\n- No hemodynamic instability\n- No saline spillover to ventilated lung\n\nPost-Lavage:\nLeft lung recruitment performed with sustained inflation. Bronchoscopy confirmed clear airways bilaterally. DLT exchanged for single-lumen 7.5 ETT. Bilateral ventilation resumed.\n\nABG post-procedure: pH 7.38, pCO2 42, pO2 185 on 50% FiO2\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None significant\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Initial lavage fluid (cytology) - showing proteinaceous material\n- Final lavage fluid (cytology) - for comparison\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE PLAN:\n- Transfer to ICU intubated for overnight observation\n- Wean ventilator as tolerated, goal extubation within 12-24 hours\n- CXR 6 hours post-procedure\n- Monitor for hypoxemia, fever\n- Plan for right lung lavage in 2-4 weeks pending recovery\n- Follow-up PFTs in 4-6 weeks\n\nIMPRESSION:\nSuccessful therapeutic whole lung lavage of left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Good lavage return (93%) with clearing of effluent. Procedure tolerated well.\n\nM. Zhang, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Large volume paracentesis performed earlier today. Thoracentesis for diagnostic workup to rule out infection (SBP equivalent) vs hepatic hydrothorax vs malignancy.\n\nPre-Procedure:\n- Consent obtained from healthcare proxy (patient intubated/sedated)\n- Coagulation: INR 1.8, Platelets 67K - thrombocytopenia noted but clinically indicated procedure\n- FFP 2 units given prior to procedure per ICU protocol\n- Post-transfusion INR: 1.4\n- Bedside US: Moderate left effusion, ~4cm depth, simple appearing\n\nProcedure:\n- Patient in right lateral decubitus position (left side up)\n- Left posterior-lateral chest wall, 7th intercostal space\n- Chlorhexidine prep, sterile drape\n- Local: 8mL 1% lidocaine\n- Ultrasound-guided 18G catheter insertion\n- Clear, transudative-appearing fluid obtained\n- Volume removed: 650mL (limited due to effusion size and patient tolerance)\n- Fluid: Clear, pale yellow\n- Post-procedure US: Minimal residual effusion, lung sliding present\n\nFluid Studies:\n- Cell count (WBC 180/uL, 12% PMN - reassuring for SBP equivalent)\n- Chemistry (protein, LDH, albumin for Light's criteria)\n- Gram stain, culture\n- Triglycerides (r/o chylothorax)\n\nComplications: None. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on vasopressors throughout.\n\nPost-Procedure:\n- CXR: Small residual effusion, no PTX\n- Respiratory status unchanged on current ventilator settings\n\nImpression: Diagnostic thoracentesis of left pleural effusion in setting of decompensated cirrhosis. Fluid appears transudative, low PMN count reassuring against infection.\n\nPlan:\n- Await final culture results\n- If hepatic hydrothorax confirmed, optimize diuresis\n- Hepatology consulted for transplant evaluation\n\nC.

      "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY FOR FOREIGN BODY REMOVAL\n\nPatient: Margaret O'Connor\nMRN: 8876543\nDOB: 11/05/1958 (67 years old)\nDate: 12/04/2025\nProcedure Time: 10:00 - 11:45\nLocation: Operating Room 3, Memorial Hospital\n\nAttending IP: Dr. Richard Martinez, MD\nAnesthesia: Dr. Laura Kim, MD\nOR Staff: RN Kelly Smith, ST John Davis\n\nHistory:\n67-year-old female with history of dysphagia secondary to stroke (2023), aspiration risk. Two days ago, patient aspirated a dental crown during a choking episode while eating. Chest CT shows metallic density in left lower lobe basilar segment. Patient with persistent cough, low-grade fever, and left-sided chest discomfort.\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Left lower lobe foreign body (dental crown)\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Same - confirmed metallic dental crown\n\nProcedures Performed:\n1. Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Flexible bronchoscopy\n3. Foreign body removal with multiple techniques\n4. Balloon dilation of LLL segmental bronchus\n\nAnesthesia: General endotracheal anesthesia (7.5 ETT initially, then exchanged for rigid)\n\nProcedure In Detail:\n\nInitial flexible bronchoscopy performed showing extensive mucopurulent secretions in LLL with visible metallic foreign body impacted in LB10 (posterior basal segment). Mucosal edema and granulation tissue noted around foreign body. Decision made to convert to rigid bronchoscopy given impacted nature.\n\nETT exchanged for rigid bronchoscope (Efer-Dumon 11mm). Foreign body visualized - gold-colored dental crown, approximately 12mm diameter, wedged tightly in LB10.\n\nRemoval Attempts:\n1. Rigid optical forceps - grasped crown but slipped due to smooth surface and impaction\n2. Dormia basket - unable to deploy past crown due to tight impaction\n3. Cryoprobe technique - limited adhesion to metallic surface, unsuccessful\n4. Snare device deployed - successfully looped around crown margin\n5. Gentle traction with snare + counter-pressure with rigid barrel\n6. Crown extracted en bloc after 20 minutes of manipulation\n\nForeign Body Retrieved:\n- Dental crown (porcelain-fused-to-metal)\n- Size: 12mm x 10mm\n- Intact, no fragments identified\n\nPost-Extraction:\n- Significant mucosal edema at impaction site with 60% narrowing of LB10\n- Balloon dilation (CRE 8-10mm) performed at 6 ATM x 2 minutes\n- Post-dilation: 80% luminal patency restored\n- Purulent secretions suctioned from LLL\n- BAL performed (30mL saline, sent for culture)\n- Hemostasis achieved with cold saline\n\nFinal inspection via flexible bronchoscopy: All airways patent, no residual foreign body, minimal bleeding.\n\nComplications: Moderate mucosal bleeding (controlled), prolonged procedure time\nEBL: 50mL\n\nSpecimens:\n- Foreign body: Returned to patient in labeled container\n- BAL: Bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures\n\nPost-Procedure:\n- Patient extubated without difficulty\n- CXR: LLL infiltrate (aspiration pneumonia), no PTX\n- SpO2 95% on 2L NC\n- Voice intact (no vocal cord injury)\n\nDisposition: Admission for 24-48 hours for IV antibiotics and monitoring\n\nPlan:\n- IV ampicillin-sulbactam for aspiration pneumonia\n- Speech therapy consult for dysphagia evaluation before advancing diet\n- Repeat CXR in 24 hours\n- Dental consultation for crown replacement and oral health\n- Neurology follow-up for stroke/dysphagia management\n- Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks if persistent symptoms\n\nR.

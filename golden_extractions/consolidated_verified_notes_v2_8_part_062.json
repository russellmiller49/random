Patient intubated with size 12 rigid bronchoscope; intermittent jet ventilation provided through the bronchoscope barrel. ASA class III.\n\nFindings:\nExophytic, friable tumor arising from the medial wall of the left mainstem bronchus, extending 2.5 cm distal to the carina and causing approximately 90% luminal obstruction with distal mucus plugging. Right-sided airways patent.\n\nInterventions:\nThe bevel of the rigid bronchoscope was used to perform repeated rigid coring and mechanical debulking passes through the tumor. Large pieces of tumor were removed with forceps and suction. A microdebrider was then introduced through the rigid scope to further debulk residual tumor until the lumen was widely patent. Overall, the tumor was debulked in piecemeal fashion with clear mechanical debulking and excision of obstructing tissue. No thermal ablation was used.\n\nHemostasis:\nMild oozing from the tumor base controlled with cold saline irrigation and topical epinephrine. No APC or laser therapy required.\n\nEstimated Blood Loss:\n25 mL.\n\nComplications:\nNone immediate. No hypoxia or hemodynamic instability.\n\nPost-procedure Airway Status:\nFinal left mainstem obstruction estimated at <20% with good visualization of segmental bronchi and restoration of airflow.\n\nDisposition:\nExtubated in the OR without difficulty and transferred to the ICU for overnight monitoring given high tumor burden and recent pneumonia.\n\nPlan:\nPost-procedure chest radiograph; resume systemic therapy per oncology; repeat bronchoscopy as needed for recurrent obstruction.",

Native airway with oral bite block. ASA class III.\n\nFindings:\nAt 2 cm above the carina there was circumferential granulation tissue and nodular scar narrowing the distal trachea to approximately 70% obstruction. No discrete mass elsewhere. Distal mainstem bronchi patent.\n\nInterventions:\nUsing large alligator forceps through the flexible bronchoscope, multiple passes of mechanical debulking were performed, removing friable granulation tissue in piecemeal fashion. Snare resection was then used to excise a central fibrotic band. The stenotic ring was mechanically disrupted, and the tracheal lumen opened significantly. No balloon dilation or thermal ablation was used. The note explicitly reflects mechanical debulking and snare resection of the obstructing lesion consistent with CPT 31640.\n\nHemostasis / Complications:\nMinor oozing controlled with cold saline; no significant bleeding. No desaturations or arrhythmias.\n\nEBL:\nApproximately 10 mL.\n\nDisposition:\nObserved for 2 hours in recovery and discharged home on inhaled corticosteroid and PPI. Follow-up bronchoscopy planned in 6\u20138 weeks to assess for recurrent stenosis.",

ASA class III.\n\nFindings:\nPolypoid, highly vascular tumor arising from lateral wall of the right mainstem, extending 1.5 cm distal to the carina and narrowing the lumen to approximately 80%. Distal lobar airways partially collapsed but reachable after debulking.\n\nIntervention Details:\nInitial inspection performed with flexible bronchoscope through the rigid barrel. After mapping, rigid coring of the tumor was performed with the bevel of the scope. Forceps debulking removed multiple tumor fragments.

ASA class IV.\n\nFindings:\nBulky, friable tumor filling the left mainstem lumen with 95% obstruction, copious mucus, and collapse of left lung. Right airway normal.\n\nInterventions:\nAfter suctioning secretions, rigid coring was performed repeatedly through the tumor using the rigid bronchoscope bevel. Large tumor chunks were removed with forceps. A microdebrider was used for fine mechanical debulking until the airway lumen was sufficiently re-opened. Tumor debulking and excision were entirely mechanical; no ablative energy (laser, RFA, PDT, or cryotherapy) was used.\n\nHemostasis:\nModerate oozing controlled with topical epinephrine and short periods of tamponade. No transfusion.\n\nEBL:\n60 mL.\n\nComplications:\nNone aside from transient desaturation to 88% during initial rigid coring, improved with recruitment.\n\nDisposition:\nRemained intubated post-procedure and transported to ICU. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed re-expansion of the left lung.",

Native airway. ASA class II.\n\nFindings:\nIrregular granulation tissue circumferentially at the mid-trachea where prior tracheostomy had been, narrowing the lumen to about 60%.\n\nInterventions:\nMultiple passes of forceps debulking were performed to remove the granulation tissue in piecemeal fashion. Snare resection was used for a pedunculated portion. The procedure consisted solely of mechanical excision and debulking; no ablation or thermal therapy was delivered.\n\nHemostasis:\nMinor oozing controlled with cold saline.\n\nEBL:\n5\u201310 mL.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nDisposition:\nObserved in recovery and discharged home with inhaled corticosteroid and PPI therapy.

ASA class III.\n\nFindings:\nPolypoid tumor at the origin of the RUL bronchus causing 80% obstruction. No other central lesions.\n\nInterventions:\nMechanical debulking performed using forceps and snare resection of the tumor. Tumor removed in piecemeal fashion until the RUL bronchus was widely patent. No thermal techniques (APC, laser, cryotherapy, PDT, or RFA) were used.\n\nHemostasis:\nMinimal; controlled with cold saline.\n\nEBL:\n10 mL.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nDisposition:\nObserved post-procedure and discharged home; CT chest ordered in 6 weeks to evaluate re-expansion.",

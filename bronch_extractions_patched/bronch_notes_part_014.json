After administration of sedatives a flexible bronchoscope was passed through the patients tracheostomy tube and into the airways. The trachea was normal. Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways. Once secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis. On the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall. Distally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy. Multiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.  At this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula. We then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction. This was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Await tissue diagnosis from biopsied endobronchial nodules\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- TID saline nebulizers along with ensuring oxygen is humidified to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.",

Tracheal stenosis s/p stent placement.\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with airway dilatation and stent insertion. \nINDICATIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis  \nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the flexible bronchoscope was inserted into the posterior oropharynx via an LMA. The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection a long segment complex tracheal stenosis was visualized beginning approximately 3cm distal to the vocal cords and extending for just under 4cm in length.  The maximal obstruction was approximately 60% of normal airway in the mid to distal aspect of the stenosis. The distal trachea was normal. The right and left sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental airways and with the exception of some thick mucus in the left lower lobe which was easily suctioned there is no endobronchial lesions or irregular mucosa.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced just proximal to the tracheal stenosis and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and a 16 x 40 uncovered Ultraflex stent was advanced into the airway alongside a pediatric bronchoscope.  The stent was deployed with direct visualization.  There was slightly distal deployment and the stent was manipulated with both flexible and rigid forceps until it was adequately seated with the proximal and distal limb just beyond the stenosis.  Balloon dilatation was then performed with a 15/16.5/18 urination dilatation of balloon to a maximum diameter of 16.5 mm.  Post dilatation the airway was approximately 90% of normal diameter.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.  \nComplications: None\nRecommendations:\nPatient to be transferred to the PACU\nDischarge home once criteria met from postprocedural Ward \nPatient to follow-up with interventional pulmonology at date to be determined",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right mainstem, protruding slightly into the supra-carinal space was a large mass causing complete obstruction. The lesion appeared to have a stock/base and we therefore secured the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare. The lesion was snared and immediately hemorrhaged briskly completely obscuring the field of view. The rigid bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem to attempt to isolate the bleeding however the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation continued to fall and the decision was made to remove the rigid scope and insert an ETT. This was done by anesthesia using an 8.0 ETT. The patient was placed right side down to protect the left lung and while suctioning blood via a flexible bronchoscope in the ETT. Vision remained poor and we utilized topical TXA and epi to try to slow the bleeding while using cryotherapy probe to pull blood clots from the airways. Eventually the bleeding stopped and the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation returned to normal. Once we were able to better visualize the airways we found that the left side had relatively mild blood spillover and at the LC1 carina the transected tumor was seen which was removed piecemeal using the cryotherapy probe.  Subsequently we began to debulk further into right lung. The right upper lobe was eventually visualized. We attempted to use APC to \"burn and shave\" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies. We were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained. Patient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date. Once this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina. The bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed. Decision in consultation with anesthesia was for patient to remain intubated for now and transfer to the ICU.\nSpecimens: Right mainstem tumor\nFluids/Blood Products:\nIVF: 1500  EBL: 200cc  Blood Products: None\n Complications: Severe hemorrhage, severe hypoxia, Escalation in level of care.\nRecommendations: \n-\tPatient to remain intubated overnight, with endobronchial blocker at bedside.\n-\tIf no bleeding overnight plan to extubate tomorrow.\n-\tWill need to discuss options moving forward. Given the extent of the tumor risk/benefit ratio of re-attempting debulking needs to be carefully considered along with alternative options such as radiotherapy.",

After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n\u2022\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n\u2022\tAwait final pathology results  \n\u2022\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.",

After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. The subglottic area and proximal trachea were normal. At the level of the med trachea there was a large polypoid tumor with a ball valve effect with the base at the left posterior tracheal wall. The tumor was about 90% obstructive of the normal tracheal diameter. Additionally there wer multiple small polypoid lesions surrounding the large obstructive mass mostly on the posterior wall of the trachea but also on the anterior and right tracheal wall. These findings extended for about 3cm. We did not attempt to pass the polypoid lesion with the bronchoscope during the initial inspection.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the obstructive mass at its base. We then inserted the 1.9mm cryotherapy probe through the flexible bronchoscope and attached the probe using cryotherapy to the resected tumor and attempted to extract it through the rigid bronchoscope. The tumor however was too large and repeatedly fell off of the cryoprobe when trying to pull it through the rigid scope. We then switched to the large 2.4mm cryoprobe and again using the same technique were able to pull pieces of the tumor out if a piecemeal fashion and residual pieces of the resected tumor were then extracted with flexible forceps. After the primary tumor was removed we then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 95% open in comparison to unaffected areas. We then were able to complete the distal airway inspection. The lower trachea, right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\nRecommendations:\n\u00b7           Transfer patient back to ICU \n\u00b7           Obtain post procedure CXR\n\u00b7           Await final pathology results",

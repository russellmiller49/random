After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords was a long segment of A-shaped stenosis measuring 3.5 cm with maximal airway obstruction of 90%.  Distal to the stenosis the mid and distal trachea appeared normal. All right and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were examined and normal without endobronchial disease or airway distortion. External markers were placed on the patient\u2019s chest with fluoroscopic observation at the proximal and distal edges of the stenosis. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea through the flexible bronchoscope. The bronchoscope was then removed with the jagwire left in place. A 16x40 mm Ultraflex uncovered self-expandable metallic stent was then inserted over the guidewire and using the external markers positioned in proper place and then deployed. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted. The stent was well positioned and partially compressed externally. A 14/16.5/18 mm Elation dilatational balloon was used to dilate the stent after which the airway was approximately 90% of normal caliber.  At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Discharge once criteria met.\n- Plan for repeat evaluation and possible stent replacement in approximately 2 weeks.",

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 3 cm distal to the vocal cords was a long segment of airway obstruction from extrinsic compression as well as submucosal infiltration. At the maximum obstruction (mid trachea the airway was approximately 70% obstructed. The tumor was mostly confined to the posterior and left lateral wall. At the distal aspect of the tumor (3cm proximal to the main carina there was an obvious fistulous communication with the esophagus in the left recess between the posterior and lateral tracheal wall.  The distal 3 cm of the trachea appeared normal. There was purulent material in the left mainstem which was suctioned and all airways beyond the trachea appeared normal without evidence of mucosal irregularities of endobronchial disease. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea and with bronchoscopic observation placed a 16x60 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent. The stent deployed more distally than expected with the distal edge within the right mainstem and the proximal edge not fully covering the obstruction. We were able to pull the stent proximally but slightly more proximal than expected to cover the upper tracheal obstruction but the distal margin and TE fistula remained exposed.  At this point our thought was that the obstruction was covered and that GI would place a stent to cover the fistula. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and GI then attempted through EGD to place the stent but were unable to bypass the esophageal obstruction. We then re-intubated with the tracheoscope and using a similar technique to before and using forceps biopsied the exposed tumor. We then placed a second 16X60 aero SEM into the distal trachea telescoping into the more proximal stent. This resulted in complete occlusion of the fistula and complete opening of the trachea to a normal diameter. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. Once the patient was felt to be able to adequately protect airway the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nPost procedure diagnosis:\nMixed infiltrative tumor of the trachea and TE fistula s/p tracheal stenting with complete recanalization and obstruction of fistula \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await tissue diagnosis\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- Transfer back to La Jolla oncology service \n- TID saline nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent",

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient\u2019s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\nPost procedure diagnosis:\n-\tStent infection\n-\tStent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.\n-\tPersistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent \n-\ts/p airway stent removal\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await cultures\n- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula\n- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.",

Once the patient was sedated and relaxed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sublottic glottic space. A flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient\u2019s Y stent was well placed without mucosal debris or obstruction. At the distal tip of the right limb was mild granulation tissue causing about 10% obstruction and at the distal tip of the left mild was moderate granulation tissue causing about 40% obstruction. The distal airways were widely patent.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optic was reinserted alongside rigid alligator forceps. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed an I-gel LMA was then placed and the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted.  There was some mild erythema in the areas of the struts from the move stent however the previously covered airways appeared to be relatively normal.  At this point  the cryotherapy probe was used to perform multiple 30 second freeze thaw cycles at the areas of residual granulation tissue within the left and right mainstems. There was some mild bleeding associated with the treatment on the left requiring cold saline and 2cc of topical epinephrine. Once we were confident that the bleeding had resolved the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\n \nComplications: None\nEBL: 5\n \nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer to PACU \n-\tDischarge patient once criteria is met\n-\tDue to lack of symptomatic response to stenting would not recommend consideration of tracheoplasty at this time. \n-\tRecommend continuing of non-invasive ventilation for now.",

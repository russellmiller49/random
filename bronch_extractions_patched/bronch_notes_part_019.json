The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion right upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion and minor adjustments were made in positioning until a concentric US view was obtained.  Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, forceps, and brush under fluoroscopic visualization. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. Specimens were sent for both microbiological and cytology/histology assessment.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None \nCOMPLICATIONS:                 None\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- S/P bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage.\n- Successful navigational localization and biopsy \nRECOMMENDATIONS\n- Transfer to post-procedural unit\n- Post-procedure CXR\n- D/C home once criteria met\n- Await pathology",

The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained. Patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by the physician, anesthesia team, nurse, and pulmonary team. Time out was performed at 0819. The bronchoscope was introduced through the laryngeal mask airway and into the trachea.  The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree of bilateral lungs was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. The right upper lobe was noted to have an anomalous inferior takeoff in addition to the anterior, apical, and posterior segments. There were no endobronchial lesions and no excessive secretions.\n The Covidien superDimension probe was then advanced and registration was performed. The right upper lobe nodule was accessed by the anomalous segment (see below), located using electromagnetic navigation and the site confirmed with radial ultrasound. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed under flouroscopic guidance and adequate tissue confirmed by ROSE. Multiple insturments to include transbronchoscopic needles, forceps (tranbronchial lung biopsy) and brushes were utilized. Five needle biopsies three forceps biopsies, and one needle brush biopsy were obtained in total. Finally, inspection bronchoscopy was performed and hemostasis was confirmed. The procedure was accomplished without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. EBL 5cc.\n\nSPECIMEN SENT TO THE LABORATORY:\n--5 needle biopsies of the right middle lobe\n--1 brush biopsies of the  right middle lobe\n--3 forceps biopsies\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n-D/C From CEC when discharge criteria are met\n-Patient will be notified when biopsy results return",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. Somewhat thick secretions were seen throughout the airways. The left sided airway anatomy was normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just proximal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Within that segment fibrotic endoluminal obstruction was seen but all other airways did not have visual endobronchial disease to at least the first sub-segmental level. Due to difficulty with maintaining position of LMA (edentulous) the decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. This was performed over the bronchoscope without difficulty and the ETT was secured approximately 2 cm above the main carina. Once the ETT was connected to ventilator, The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted through the tube and advanced to the orifice of the accessory left lower lobe bronchus and the radial ultrasound was advanced through the scope into the sub-segment and a concentric view of the lesion was visualized within the segment. Multiple forceps biopsies were then performed. The lesion was extremely firm and samples were relatively scant. We then utilized the super-dimension 21G peripheral needle and the 19G Olympus peripheral needle to obtain a total of 6 endobronchial needle biopsies of the lesion which were placed in formalin. After adequate samples were obtained repeat inspection was performed and no evidence of bleeding or other complications were seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe accessory segment fibrotic endobronchial lesion.\n- Await final pathology",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway. The Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. There were no endobronchial lesions.  Following inspection the bronchoscope was wedged in the anterior segment of the left lower lobe and BAL was performed with 150cc of instilled saline and 55 cc return. Once this was completed the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n Complications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: None\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL of LLL\n- Will await cytological and microbiological evaluation of collected lavage.",

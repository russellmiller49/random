Rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal\n2. Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC\n\nINDICATION: 69-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was placed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius patent\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent\n\nFinal inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS: None (stent sent to pathology for documentation)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: 15mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Same day discharge anticipated. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks to assess granulation tissue recurrence.\n\nDr. David Chen, MD\nDr. Katherine Wong, MD",

Rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal\n2. Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC\n\nINDICATION: 70-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was placed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius patent\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent\n\nFinal inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS: None (stent sent to pathology for documentation)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: 15mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Same day discharge anticipated. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks to assess granulation tissue recurrence.\n\nDr. David Chen, MD\nDr. Katherine Wong, MD",

The procedure was completed without immediate complications. \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Specimens obtained were sent for appropriate analysis and results will be reviewed at follow-up. The preliminary assessment is benign. \n\nProcedural coding: 31635, 31641.",

Rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal\n2. Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC\n\nINDICATION: 71-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was installed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT revealed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared navigable.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius navigable\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices navigable\n\nFinal inspection revealed no debris, no significant bleeding, navigable airways bilaterally. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS: None (stent sent to pathology for documentation)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: 15mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Same day discharge anticipated. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks to assess granulation tissue recurrence.\n\nDr. David Chen, MD\nDr. Katherine Wong, MD",

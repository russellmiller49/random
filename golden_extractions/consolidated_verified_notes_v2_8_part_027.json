The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to tunneled pleural catheter placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion, right\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Catheter Placement (CPT 32550)\nATTENDING: Dr. Rachel Green\nASSISTANT: Dr. Paul Anderson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jennifer Martinez\nRT: David Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1%\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, blood pressure\nINSTRUMENT: CareFusion PleurX catheter system, ultrasound machine\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated\nCHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)\n\nHemithorax: Right\nPleural Effusion Volume: Large\nEchogenicity: Anechoic\nLoculations: None\nDiaphragmatic Motion: Diminished\nLung sliding before procedure: Present\nLung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)\nPleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized\n\nThe right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.\nANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract\nEntry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space\nLocation: Mid-axillary line\nProcedure Steps:\n\nA finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.\nSterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).\n\nExit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line\nInitial Drainage:\nThe PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.\n\nFluid Removed: 1200 mL\nAppearance: Serous, straw-colored\n\nPleural Pressures Measured:\n\nOpening: -8 cmH\u2082O\n500ml: -10 cmH\u2082O\n1000ml: -15 cmH\u2082O\n1200ml: -18 cmH\u2082O (stopped due to chest discomfort)\n\nDrainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nPost-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Johnson underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion. Procedure completed without complications. Patient and family educated on catheter care and home drainage protocol. Drainage every other day initially, adjusting based on output. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Home health nursing arranged for first drainage. Patient given written discharge instructions and emergency contact information.",

    "note_text": "Patient: Harold Stevens | Age: 66 | Sex: M | MRN: 1256170\nDate: October 8, 2024\nAttending: Dr. Nicole Turner\nClinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.\nWe discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.\nProcedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement\nHow it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.\nThrough the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.\nMultiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.\nAfter biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.\nPathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry\nPatient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.\nFollow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.",

After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.\nInitial Bronchoscopic Survey:\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:\n\nUpper airways: Normal\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\nRight bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions\nLeft bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus\n\nTumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):\n\nLocation: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall\nSize: 1.8cm (longitudinal) \u00d7 0.9cm (circumferential extent)\nMorphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion\nColor: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization\nSurface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance\nObstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing\nDistal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:\nLaser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.\nTreatment Parameters:\n\nWavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)\nPower output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length\nDiffuser length: 2.5 cm\nTotal power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)\nLight dose (fluence): 200 J/cm\u00b2 of diffuser surface\nTreatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)\nCalculation: 200 J/cm\u00b2 \u00f7 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds\n\nLight was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:\n\nLaser energy meter verified consistent power output\nNo visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)\nNo charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)\nPatient hemodynamically stable throughout\nNo arrhythmias or desaturations\n\nPost-Treatment Assessment:\nImmediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.\nLight Precautions Review:\nPost-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:\n\nStrict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum\nWear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors\nGradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing\nEmergency contact information provided\nWritten instructions given\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient Michael Torres 59M MRN 1589403, October 15 2024, Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.",

    "note_text": "Bronchoscopy Note\nPatient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female\nDate: October 17, 2024\nDoc: Dr. Steven Park\nMRN: 1690514\nSo Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.\nBrought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).\nSo here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.\nAfter cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.\nThe distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.\nDid a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.\nRecommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.\nOverall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",

Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.\nRUSHED TO BEDSIDE\nArrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.\nSCOPE FINDINGS:\nETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.\nRIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal\nLEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.\nINITIAL MEASURES:\n\nIced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope\nSome temporary improvement but bleeding continues\nEpi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect\nTranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction\n\nBALLOON TAMPONADE:\nBlood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.\nKept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.\nSecond deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.\nFINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:\nAfter tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.\nSPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)\nPLAN:\n\nICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)\nKeep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning\nReverse any coagulopathy (check labs)\nCTA chest to identify bleeding vessel\nIR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am\nI'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR\nIf rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation\n\nUPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently. IR taking to angio suite. Will follow up later this AM.",

She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:\n\nRight mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung\nMalignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)\nRight malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells\n\nThe patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING\nPre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:\n\nAddress airway obstruction first (most critical)\nFollow with pericardial window creation\nComplete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates\n\nINFORMED CONSENT\nExtensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:\n\nBleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)\nPerforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)\nArrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)\nHypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)\nNeed for ICU care postoperatively (expected)\nMortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)\n\nBenefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.\nAlternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).\nPatient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\n\nRecurrent adenocarcinoma of right lung with endobronchial obstruction (C34.11)\nMalignant pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology (I31.3, C38.0)\nMalignant pleural effusion, right (J91.0)\nRespiratory failure, acute on chronic (J96.20)\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\nSame as preoperative\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n\nRigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial tumor debridement\nElectrocautery and argon plasma coagulation of endobronchial tumor\nBalloon dilation of right mainstem bronchus stenosis\nMetallic airway stent placement, right mainstem bronchus\nFlexible bronchoscopy with inspection and therapeutic aspiration\nSubxiphoid pericardial window creation (performed by CT surgery)\nPericardial biopsy\nTunneled pleural catheter placement, right hemithorax\n\nCPT CODES\n\n31640 (Bronchoscopy with tumor excision)\n31641 (Bronchoscopy with destruction of tumor)\n31630 (Bronchoscopy with dilation)\n31631 (Bronchoscopy with stent placement)\n31645 (Bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration)\n33015 (Pericardial window, subxiphoid)\n32550 (Insertion of indwelling pleural catheter)\n\n\nANESTHESIA DETAILS\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nInduction: Fentanyl 150mcg IV, Propofol 180mg IV, Rocuronium 50mg IV\nMaintenance: Sevoflurane 1.5-2.5% with intermittent propofol boluses, Fentanyl infusion\nAirway: Initial 8.0mm oral endotracheal tube, exchanged to rigid bronchoscope\nMonitoring:\n\nStandard ASA monitors (ECG, NIBP, pulse oximetry, capnography, temperature)\nArterial line - left radial artery\nCentral venous catheter - right internal jugular (placed by anesthesia for access/monitoring)\nTransesophageal echocardiography probe (for pericardial window portion)\nNeuromuscular blockade monitoring\n\nHemodynamics: Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout with MAP 65-85mmHg, HR 75-95 bpm. Vasopressor support with phenylephrine intermittent boluses (total 400mcg). Post-pericardial drainage, improvement in cardiac output noted on TEE.",

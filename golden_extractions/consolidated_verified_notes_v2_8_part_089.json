An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t13\t354\t18\t100\t5\t17\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.6mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the LUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB1+2) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Apicoposterior Segment of LUL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 6 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 6 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nMiller, MD",

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t11\t355\t12\t100\t5\t18\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.1mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB1) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Apical Segment of RUL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Concentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 7 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at RB1. 60mL NS instilled with 27mL return. Sent for Cell count, Culture, and Cytology.\n\nGold fiducial marker placed under fluoroscopic guidance for radiation therapy planning.\n\nROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nPark, MD",

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t13\t398\t18\t100\t6\t24\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.0mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RML. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB5) to provide stability.

Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 8 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 7 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nGold fiducial marker placed under fluoroscopic guidance for radiation therapy planning.\n\nROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nBrown, MD",

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t11\t335\t10\t100\t6\t17\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.5mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the LUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB1+2) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Apicoposterior Segment of LUL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Concentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 19G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 7 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 5 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Benign respiratory epithelium and macrophages\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nGarcia, MD",

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t13\t337\t10\t100\t6\t21\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.8mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the Lingula. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB4) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Superior Lingula.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 4 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 7 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Granulomatous inflammation\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nDavis, MD",

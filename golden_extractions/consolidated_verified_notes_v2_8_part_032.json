    "note_text": "PATIENT: Thomas Anderson, 61-year-old Male\nMRN: 7016954\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Anderson is a 61-year-old male with mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown etiology. Two prior EBUS-TBNA attempts at outside hospital yielded non-diagnostic specimens. PET-CT shows intensely FDG-avid station 4R and station 7 nodes. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to EBUS with intranodal forceps biopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, etiology unknown\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: EBUS-Guided Intranodal Forceps Biopsy (CPT 31652, 31653)\nATTENDING: Dr. Lisa Murphy\nASSISTANT: Dr. John Mitchell, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Patricia Davis\nRT: James Wilson\n\nANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation with Midazolam 3mg IV and Fentanyl 150mcg IV\nMONITORING: Continuous pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus BF-UC180F EBUS bronchoscope, 21G EBUS needle, 1.1mm mini-forceps\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter sedation and timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nThe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the oral route. 5cc of 2% lidocaine was instilled for topical anesthesia. Initial airway inspection was unremarkable.\nStation 4R (Right paratracheal):\n\nSize: 24mm (short axis)\nEcho Features: Heterogeneous, irregular borders, comet-tail artifacts suggestive of calcification\nPET SUV: 8.5\n\nInitial TBNA with 21G needle was performed (3 passes). ROSE showed predominantly inflammatory cells with necrotic debris, non-diagnostic.\nIntranodal Forceps Biopsy Technique:\nThe EBUS 21G needle was used to create a tract through the bronchial wall and nodal capsule under real-time ultrasound guidance. The needle was removed and 1.1mm mini-forceps were advanced through the established tract into the lymph node under ultrasound visualization. The forceps jaws were opened and visible ultrasound artifact confirmed intra-nodal position. Four core samples were obtained with visible tissue in forceps each time.\nROSE on forceps specimens: Adequate cellularity with necrotizing granulomas and multinucleated giant cells, consistent with granulomatous inflammation.\nStation 7 (Subcarinal):\n\nSize: 18mm (short axis)\nEcho Features: Similar to 4R with heterogeneous pattern\nPET SUV: 7.2\n\nSimilar intranodal forceps biopsy technique performed with 3 core samples obtained. ROSE: Granulomatous inflammation.\nHemostasis was adequate after each sampling with no immediate complications. Final inspection showed no bleeding.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. The attending, Dr. Murphy, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nStation 4R: TBNA x3 (cytology), IFB x4 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)\nStation 7: IFB x3 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Anderson underwent successful EBUS with intranodal forceps biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes. Preliminary cytology shows necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Differential includes sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, fungal infection. Awaiting AFB and fungal cultures. Infectious disease consultation requested. Follow up in clinic in 1 week.",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: Michael Thompson\nMRN: 7294163\nDate of Procedure: March 1, 2021\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement\n\nSurgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD\nIndications: Airway obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.\n\nAirway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.\n\nTumor debulking was performed using APC to \"burn and shave\" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\n\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Post-procedure x-ray\n- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance\n- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\n\nJennifer Williams, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology\nNaval Medical Center San Diego\n\n________________________________________",

CT imaging shows target left upper lobe with fissure integrity >95%. Chartis assessment confirms absence of collateral ventilation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to endobronchial valve therapy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe heterogeneous emphysema with target left upper lobe\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Endobronchial Valve Placement (CPT 31647, 31648)\nATTENDING: Dr. Catherine Lee\nASSISTANT: Dr. Brian Thompson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Michelle Rodriguez\nRT: Steven Clark\nAnesthesia: Dr. Jennifer Adams\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope, Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System, Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Pulmonx)\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.5 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived. Patient received Cefazolin 2g IV and Methylprednisolone 125mg IV prior to procedure.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT. Complete airway survey showed:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nRight lung: Patent airways, emphysematous changes\nLeft lung: Patent airways with severe emphysematous destruction especially in upper lobe segments\n\nChartis Assessment:\nBalloon occlusion of the left upper lobe was performed at the LUL orifice using the Chartis balloon catheter. The balloon was inflated with saline to achieve complete occlusion confirmed visually and by loss of airflow.\nChartis Results:\n\nTest duration: 6 minutes\nFlow: Declined to zero by minute 4\nResistance: Progressive increase\nConclusion: CV NEGATIVE (no collateral ventilation detected)\n\nBased on Chartis confirmation of absent collateral ventilation, proceeded with valve placement.\nValve Placement:\nThe following Zephyr Endobronchial Valves were deployed:\n\nLB1+2 (Apical-posterior segment): 4.0mm valve\nLB1+2c (Anterior segment): 4.0mm valve\nLB3 (Superior segment): 4.0mm valve\n\nAll valves were deployed under direct visualization using the Zephyr Loading System. Each valve expanded appropriately and demonstrated one-way valve function with visible flutter during expiration and occlusion during inspiration. Final bronchoscopic inspection confirmed:\n\nAll three valves in good position\nComplete LUL occlusion achieved\nNo airflow detected through valves\nNo immediate complications\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Lee, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S): None\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Harris underwent successful endobronchial valve placement in the left upper lobe for severe emphysema.

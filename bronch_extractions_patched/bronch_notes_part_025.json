The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.\n \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.\n \nPROCEDURE:  \n31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode\n31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    \n31628 TBBX single lobe     \n31629 TBNA single lobe   \n31653 EBUS sampling 3 or more nodes  \n31654 Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion\n76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion\n76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Targets \n76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Target 2\n \nATTENDING:  \nDuane Johnson MD PhD\n \nASSISTANT:   none\n \nSupport Staff: \nRN: Rebecca Loman andWilliam Shakespeak\nRT: Philip Knight\n \nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n \nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n \nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nLinear EBUS \nRadial EBUS\n \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None\n \nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n \nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. \n \nPATIENT POSITION: . \n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. \n \nTherapeutic bronchoscope was parked in RML; lateral segment was engaged.\n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.\n \nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle and 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n \nTransbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n \nROSE from procedure was noted to be:\nConclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm\n \nEBUS-Findings\nIndications: Diagnostic and Staging\nTechnique:\nAll lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.\n \nLymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.\n \nLymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 2R (upper paratracheal) node\n2L (upper paratracheal) node\n4R (lower paratracheal) node\n4L (lower paratracheal) node\n7 (subcarinal) node\n10R lymph node\n10L lymph node\n11Rs lymph node\n11Ri lymph node\n11L lymph node\n \nNo immediate complications\n \nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1\u20133), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. \n \nLymph Nodes Evaluated:\nSite 1: The 11L lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.\n \nSite 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\n \nSite 3: The 11Rs lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nRML TBBX, TBNA, BAL\nTBNA 11L, 11R, 7\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Elizabeth Larkin is a 89 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung mass evaluation.\n- f/u in clinic\n- complete pred course and zpak\n- f/u cxr\n \nDuane Johnson , MD, PhD\n12/16/2025",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\n \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\n \nPROCEDURE:  \n31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode\n31629 TBNA single lobe   \n31627 Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted)\n77012 Radiology / radiologic guidance for CT guided needle placement (CIOS)\n76377 3D rendering with interpretation and reporting of CT, US, Tomo modality (ION Planning Station)\n31654 Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion\n31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)\n \n \nATTENDING:  \nDuane Johnson MD PhD and Hector Martinez MD\n \nASSISTANT:   none\n \nSupport Staff: \nRN: Kimberlyn Hill\nRT: Christopher Reeves  and Philip Knight\n \nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n \nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n \nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nFlexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope\nRadial EBUS\nIon Robotic Bronchoscope\n \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum\n \nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n \nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius  from mucus. \n \n \nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. \n \nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t12 \t300\t12\t100\t10\t15\n \nRUL Mass: \n \nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 4.0 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. \n \nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. \n \nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.\n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric after initial needle puncture into the lesion.  The following features were noted: continuous margin, heterogenous echotexture.\n \nOnce a tunnel had been created into the lesion with TBNA as above, Transbronchial microwave ablation was performed of the nodule as below. \n \nModality\tTools\tSetting/Mode\tDuration\tResults\nMicrowave \tMedium Antenna \t90*C\t20:00 min\tTransbronchial Ablation of Nodule\n \n \nSubsequently, RB2 was engaged.  And microwave catheter was placed in the lateral superior aspect of the lung mass. CBCT was done to confirm the location. \n \nModality\tTools\tSetting/Mode\tDuration\tResults\nMicrowave \tMedium Antenna \t90*C\t10:00 min\tTransbronchial Ablation of Nodule\n \nSubsequently, RB1 was engaged.  And microwave catheter was placed in the superior medial aspect of the lung mass. CBCT was done to confirm the location. \n \nModality\tTools\tSetting/Mode\tDuration\tResults\nMicrowave \tMedium Antenna \t90*C\t10:00 min\tTransbronchial Ablation of Nodule\n \nCone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.

I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. The images confirmed tool-in-lesion. \n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \n- RUL mass TBNA (cyto)\n \n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Tammy Adams is a 63 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung nodules.\nRLL nodule and RUL mass underwent TBNA and MWA. \n \n- f/u CXR\n- admit to medicine for observation\n- monitor for post-ablation pain \n- start empiric abx (IV unasyn as inpatient, po moxifloxacin as an outpatient) \n \n \nDuane Johnson , MD, PhD\n12/16/2025",

Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.\u00a0 The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered. \u00a0 Fluid Removed: 1250_ ml \u200cX \u00a0Serous \u00a0\u200c Serosanguinous \u200c Bloody\u00a0 \u200c Chylous \u200c Other: \u00a0 Pleural pressures:\u00a0\u00a0If not measured, please check here \u200cX Opening:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 500 ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 1000ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 2000ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Drainage device:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cX Pleurovac\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Drainage Bag\u00a0 \u200c Heimlich Valve\u00a0 \u200c Pneumostat\u00a0\u200c Other: Suction: \u200c X No \u200cYes, - ___ cmH20 \u00a0 CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X \u200c Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Right \u200c Left \u00a0 Pleural Effusion: Volume:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c X None\u00a0 \u200c Minimal\u00a0\u200c Small\u00a0 \u200c Moderate\u00a0 \u200c Large Echogenicity:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Anechoic\u00a0 \u200c Hypoechoic\u00a0 \u200c Isoechoic\u00a0\u200c Hyperechoic Loculations:\u00a0 \u200c None\u00a0 \u200cThin\u00a0 \u200c Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X \u200c Normal\u00a0 \u200c Diminished\u00a0\u200c Absent\u00a0 Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X\u00a0 \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: \u200c Present \u00a0X\u200c\u00a0Absent Pleura: X \u200c Normal\u00a0\u200c Thick\u00a0 \u200c Nodular \u00a0 SPECIMEN(S): \u200cX \u00a0LDH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200cGlucose\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cT.

Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.\u00a0 The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered. \u00a0 Fluid Removed: 650_ ml \u200c \u00a0Serous \u00a0\u200cX Serosanguinous \u200c Bloody\u00a0 \u200c Chylous \u200c Other: \u00a0 Pleural pressures:\u00a0\u00a0If not measured, please check here \u200cX Opening:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 500 ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 1000ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 2000ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Drainage device:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cX Pleurovac\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Drainage Bag\u00a0 \u200c Heimlich Valve\u00a0 \u200c Pneumostat\u00a0\u200c Other: Suction: \u200c No X \u200cYes, - 20_ cmH20 \u00a0 CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X \u200c Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Right X \u200c Left \u00a0 Pleural Effusion: Volume:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c None\u00a0 \u200c Minimal\u00a0\u200c X Small\u00a0 \u200c Moderate\u00a0 \u200c Large Echogenicity:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Anechoic\u00a0 \u200cX Hypoechoic\u00a0 \u200c Isoechoic\u00a0\u200c Hyperechoic Loculations:\u00a0 \u200c None\u00a0 \u200cX Thin\u00a0 \u200c Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: \u200c Normal\u00a0 X \u200c Diminished\u00a0\u200c Absent\u00a0 Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X\u00a0 \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: \u200c X Present \u00a0\u200c\u00a0Absent Pleura: \u200c Normal\u00a0 X\u200c Thick\u00a0 \u200c Nodular \u00a0 SPECIMEN(S): \u200cX \u00a0LDH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200cGlucose\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cT.

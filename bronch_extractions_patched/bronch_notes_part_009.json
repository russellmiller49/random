    "note_text": "Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy\nProcedure: EBUS bronchoscopy\nMedications: General Anesthesia\nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 4R, lymph node was identified and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 19G Visioshot EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Initial rapid onsite evaluation showed scattered lymphocytes but no evidence of malignancy or granuloma. We then placed the Olympus mini-forceps through the working channel of the EBUS scope and adnaved the forceps through a tract in the airway created by the EBUS needle. We were able to visualize the forceps using the EBUS ultrasound within the lymph node. We then closed and retracted the forceps. This was performed twice and touchpreps were made with the collected specimins which showed abundant non-caseating granulomas on rapid onsite pathological evaluation. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. \n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 5cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle and mini-forceps.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 7, lymph node was identified and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed malignancy. Samples were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and DECAMP research bronchoscopy was performed with endobronchial forceps biopsy of the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and left upper lobe as well as endobronchial brushing of bronchus intermedius. After suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. \n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 5cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies and DECAMP research protocol. \n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  Bronchial stumps from previous right upper and right middle lobe resections were intact. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was not met in any of the accessible lymph node stations. The EBUS bronchoscope was then advanced into the right lower lobe and a 11.4mm hypoechoic nodule was visualized with ultrasound. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle with a total of 9 needle passes. Preliminary ROSE indicated malignancy. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the attached EBUS procedural sheet. All samples were sent for routine cytology. \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post procedure monitoring unit.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, there were thick non-purulent sections in multiple airways which were suctioned.  Following inspection a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180cc instillation and 70cc return. The super-dimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest.  Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen.  Subsequently further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation.  After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nRecommendation:\n- CXR to r/o PTX\n- Await path results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L, station 7, 10R 11Rs lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning at the N3 (11L) lymph nodes \uf0e07\uf0e011Rs\uf0e010R. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the attached EBUS procedural sheet. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path eval did not identify malignancy. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the right middle lobe to the area of known nodule using radial EBUS confirmed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. While emerging from anesthesia patient had large volume emesis and possible aspiration event. He was immediately placed on right side. He transiently became hypoxic but saturations improved relatively quickly. Patinet was then transferred to the PACU. X-ray was performed which right greater than left patchy opacities with increased pulmonary vasculature and interstitial markings alone with a small right apical pneumothorax. Right sided airspace opacities, although possibly representing aspiration event, are more likely related to retained saline instilled during bronchoscopy and is not unexpected. Patient was informed of pneumothorax. He was hemodynamically stable and oxygenating well. Repeat CXR 1 hour later showed no expansion of pneumothorax and decision was made to observe for expansion and not place chest tube unless he develops symptoms or has expansion of pneumothorax.\n\nComplications: \n1.\tSmall left apical pneumothorax\n2.\tPost procedure emesis with possible aspiration  \nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.\nRecommendations:\n- Admit to IM for overnight observation\n- Repeat CXR in 4 hours and then AM if not changes\n- Consider diuresis given pulmonary edema and Systolic heart failure\n- Continue to hold Plavix for now.\n- Would NOT treat with antibiotics \n- Await final pathology",

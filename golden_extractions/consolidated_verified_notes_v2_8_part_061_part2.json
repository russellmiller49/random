A single-port semi-rigid thoracoscope was introduced at the 6th intercostal space. Approximately 1.1 L of cloudy, straw-colored fluid was drained. Thoracoscopic inspection revealed diffuse granular parietal pleural thickening with scattered small nodules and fibrin strands.

A semi-rigid thoracoscope was introduced at the 5th intercostal space. 600 mL of clear, yellow exudate was drained. Parietal pleura showed fine nodularity along the ribs. Multiple biopsies (8 samples) were obtained. No pleurodesis was done. A 16 Fr chest tube was left to drain.\nComplications: None.\nEstimated blood loss: 10 mL.\nDisposition: Observed overnight on pulmonary ward.\nPlan: Send pleural tissue for histology and special stains; adjust sarcoidosis therapy pending results.",

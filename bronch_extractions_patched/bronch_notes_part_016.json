The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina\u2019s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nAwait tissue diagnosis\nASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.\nIf patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. \nIf obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once adequate anesthesia and muscle relaxation were achieved a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted past the vocal cords and into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection, the trachea was normal without evidence of endobronchial or extrinsic obstruction. The left aspect of the carina was sharp and left sided airways were normal to at least the first sub-segmental bronchi. On the right there was near complete endobronchial tumor obstruction (95%) in the right mainstem at extending beyond the right upper lobe stump into the bronchus intermedius. Endobronchial forceps biopsies were performed in the right mainstem. After which the FIO2 was reduced to 30% and argon plasma coagulation was used to superficially burn the obstructive tumor followed by shaving of charred tumor with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope and removal of loose fragments using flexible forceps. This was repeated until eventually we were able to achieve about 85% re-canalization of the proximal right sided airways. Once the main obstruction was bypassed, in the distal bronchus intermedius there was significant submucosal tumor infiltration causing at least 80% obstruction up to the level of the right middle lobe stump. APC was used in a similar fashion to debulk resulting in about 70% re-canalization.   Anatomic distortion (bronchial kink) was seen further obstructing the right lower lobe (approximately 40%) but within the right lower lobe the airways were widely patient. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria are met \n- Urgent radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the right sided airways in an attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.",

The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. The T180 theraputic flexible bronchoscope was insterted through the rigid bronchoscope and airway inspection was performed. The proximal and mid trachea were normal. There was tumor infiltration within the distal trachea just proximal to the main carina on the right lateral wall with slowly oozing blood visualized. That main carina was involved on the right side. The left sided aiways were normal.  The proximal right mainstem was completely obstructed with friable enbdobronchial tumor APC was used to burn and shave the tumor and flexible forceps were used for biopsy. As we slowly debulked the tumor it became clear that the involvement was extensive. Using the P90 slim bronchoscope we were able to bypass tumor using saline aliquots to stent the airway open and eventually could visualize the basilar segments of the lower lobe where persistent tumor was seen. Using a forgery balloon and the pullback method we were able to dilate the airway slightly and then using an 8,9,10 CRE balloon gently dilated the BI and RLL bronchus. While bleeding was encountered it was not brisk and was controlled with tropical TXA, epi and cold saline. While considering stent placement the patient\u2019s blood pressure began to slowly drop despite increasing vasopressor requirement and patient went into PEA/Asystole. Code blue was called and CRP initiated. A left sided chest tube was placed and there was no gush of air concerning for PTX. Ultrasound showed no cardiac motion and no evidence of pericardial effusion. Patient received multiple doses of epinephrine and chest compressions but remained in non-shockable rhythm (asystole).  Decision was made to attempt TPA given that all other H\u2019s and T\u2019s were considered and not apparent. This did not have any effect. While we were confident that a right sided PTX was not present (lung completely obstructed by tumor and atelectatic) A right sided chest tube was placed to attempt to offload pressure from known pleural effusion again without response. At hat 15:10 after approximately 30 minutes of CPR the patient was declared dead. Family was notified and handled information appropriately. Medical examiner was contacted and declined case.  \nComplications:  Intra-operative death (direct cause unclear)",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal. In the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.  The LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal. Most of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes. After extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL. The tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.  APC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor. At the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed. The left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent. The lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nTransfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria met. \nWill discuss with oncology if biopsy samples obtained during procedure need any specific mutational analysis. \nDefer to oncology regarding medical and radiation treatment. \nWill monitor for symptoms or radiographic signs of tumor regrowth and possible need for repeat debulking to salvage left upper lobe.",

The patient was sedated in the upright position and once anesthesia was comfortable that she could be ventilated, muscle relaxation was given and the patient was laid flat. A 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced past the near complete mid-tracheal extrinsic compression and connected to the Jet ventilator while in the distal trachea.  The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. The distal trachea was approximately 60% obstructed extrinsically. The proximal 2/3 of the left mainstem were extrinsically compressed by about 50%. The distal left mainstem and left sided airways were normal the right mainstem and distal airways appeared normal without compression, mucosal changes or endobronchial disease.  After measuring the airways we customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 90mm in the tracheal limb, 16mm in the right mainstem limb and 33mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. During this short period patient was difficult to ventilate and oxygen desaturation occurred. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted. She was easily ventilated and oxygen saturation quickly returned to normal. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The Stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords. The mid-stent was compressed by the extrinsic force of the mediastinal mass to 60% of normal. The left mainstem and right mainstem were widely patent. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back  to ICU\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- TID hypertonic nebulizers with albuterol (3cc 3% and 2cc albuterol) to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent\n- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n- Discuss with IR for biopsy\n- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\t\n- Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.",

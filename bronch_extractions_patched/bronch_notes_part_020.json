All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record.

A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. airway and tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. The right upper and middle lobe were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. Within the right lower lobe a polypoid  endobronchial tumor was visualized obstructing the anterior, lateral and posterior basilar segments just distal to the medial basal segment. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Using the electrocautery snare we were able to remove the endobronchial lesion which was sent for pathological evaluation. The distal airways were noted to have purulent post-obstructive secretions which were suctioned and removed. Mild bleeding was seen at the base and using APC non-contact electrocautery we were able to cauterize this area. Post intervention the right lower lobe was approximately 90% patient.  After observing the area of interest to ensure there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\n\nComplications: \n-None \nEstimated Blood Loss:  10 cc.\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await biopsy results \n- Discharge home once criteria met.",

The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 7. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation revealed benign lymphocytes. The bronchoscope was then removed and the PX190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe to the area of known nodule within the Apical-posterior segment the lesion was identified visually. Biopsies were then performed with micro forceps.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy within the lesion.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 re-inserted into the airways. We then observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \nComplications: \t\n-None \nEstimated Blood Loss:  less than 5 cc.\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to post-op ward\n- Await biopsy results \n- Discharge home once criteria met.",

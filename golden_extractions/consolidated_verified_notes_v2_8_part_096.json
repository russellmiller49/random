The patient has experienced exercise intolerance and difficulty clearing secretions over the past 2 weeks. Recent CT imaging demonstrated bronchial anastomosis narrowing. Pulmonary function testing showed variable extrathoracic obstruction.\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nDiagnostic and therapeutic flexible bronchoscopy with balloon dilation of bronchial anastomosis stenosis (CPT Code: 31630)\n\nANESTHESIA AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT:\nGeneral anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia team. Airway was secured with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE:\nFollowing standard preparation and time-out verification, the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic airway inspection was performed.\n\nBRONCHOSCOPIC FINDINGS:\nThe vocal cords demonstrated normal mobility bilaterally without evidence of paralysis or lesion. The bronchial anastomosis stenosis was identified at left/right mainstem bronchus at anastomotic site. The stenosis was characterized as circumferential fibrous scarring with approximately 77% luminal compromise. Stenosis length measured approximately 1.5 cm. The airways distal to the stenosis appeared patent without additional pathology.\n\nTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:\nA Hurricane balloon was utilized for graduated airway dilation:\n- Initial dilation: 6mm balloon inflated to rated burst pressure for 30 seconds\n- Intermediate dilation: 8mm balloon inflated for 30 seconds\n- Final dilation: 10mm balloon inflated for 30 seconds\n\nA total of 4 inflation cycles were performed. Post-dilation inspection demonstrated improvement in luminal patency from approximately 23% to 79% of expected diameter. Minor mucosal disruption was noted without significant hemorrhage. Topical epinephrine (1:10,000) was applied prophylactically.\n\nSPECIMENS OBTAINED: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None encountered\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE MANAGEMENT:\nThe patient was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Intravenous dexamethasone 8mg was administered to reduce post-procedural airway edema. The patient was admitted for overnight observation given the degree of stenosis.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nAnastomotic bronchial stricture post lung transplant with successful balloon dilation. Airway patency improved from 23% to 79% estimated lumen.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Repeat bronchoscopy with dilation planned in 4 weeks to assess durability of response\n2. Pulmonary function testing prior to repeat procedure for objective assessment\n3. Consider airway stent placement if adequate lumen cannot be maintained with serial dilations\n4. Voice rest for 24 hours, soft diet\n5. Patient instructed to seek immediate medical attention for worsening stridor, respiratory distress, or hemoptysis\n\nProcedure performed by: Dr. S.

Shah\n\n\nCLINICAL INDICATION:\nIdiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS)\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThis is a 50-year-old female patient with history of recurrent idiopathic subglottic stenosis, 2 prior dilations. The patient has experienced exercise intolerance and recurrent respiratory infections over the past 5 weeks. Recent CT imaging demonstrated subglottic narrowing. Pulmonary function testing showed variable extrathoracic obstruction.\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nDiagnostic and therapeutic flexible bronchoscopy with balloon dilation of subglottic region stenosis (CPT Code: 31630)\n\nANESTHESIA AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT:\nGeneral anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia team. Airway was secured with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE:\nFollowing standard preparation and time-out verification, the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic airway inspection was performed.\n\nBRONCHOSCOPIC FINDINGS:\nThe vocal cords demonstrated normal mobility bilaterally without evidence of paralysis or lesion. Subglottic stenosis was identified at immediately below vocal cords. The stenosis was characterized as mature cicatricial stricture with approximately 71% luminal compromise. Stenosis length measured approximately 1.0 cm. The airways distal to the stenosis appeared patent without additional pathology.\n\nTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:\nA Hurricane balloon was utilized for graduated airway dilation:\n- Initial dilation: 10mm balloon inflated to nominal pressure for 90 seconds\n- Intermediate dilation: 12mm balloon inflated for 90 seconds\n- Final dilation: 15mm balloon inflated for 90 seconds\n\nA total of 3 inflation cycles were performed. Post-dilation inspection demonstrated improvement in luminal patency from approximately 29% to 68% of expected diameter. Minor mucosal disruption was noted without significant hemorrhage. Topical epinephrine (1:10,000) was applied prophylactically.\n\nSPECIMENS OBTAINED: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: minimal mucosal bleeding, self-limited\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE MANAGEMENT:\nThe patient was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Intravenous dexamethasone 10mg was administered to reduce post-procedural airway edema. The patient was admitted for overnight observation given the degree of stenosis.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nIdiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) with successful balloon dilation.

    "note_text": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY\nBRONCHOSCOPY WITH THERAPEUTIC AIRWAY DILATION\n\nPatient Name: Garcia, Ana\nMedical Record Number: 6850485\nDate of Service: 2024-06-17\nAttending Physician: Dr. B. Martinez\nFellow: Dr. P. Kumar (PGY-6)\n\nCLINICAL INDICATION:\nTracheal granulation tissue with stenosis post tracheostomy decannulation\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThis is a 48-year-old female patient with decannulated 10 weeks ago after neuromuscular disease months of tracheostomy. The patient has experienced recurrent respiratory infections and biphasic stridor at rest over the past 9 weeks. Recent CT imaging demonstrated mid-trachea narrowing. Pulmonary function testing showed fixed upper airway obstruction pattern.\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nDiagnostic and therapeutic flexible bronchoscopy with balloon dilation of mid-trachea stenosis (CPT Code: 31630)\n\nANESTHESIA AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT:\nMAC anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia team. Airway was secured with LMA.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE:\nFollowing standard preparation and time-out verification, the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) was introduced transnasally. Systematic airway inspection was performed.\n\nBRONCHOSCOPIC FINDINGS:\nThe vocal cords demonstrated normal mobility bilaterally without evidence of paralysis or lesion. The mid-trachea stenosis was identified at mid-trachea at prior stoma site. The stenosis was characterized as circumferential fibrous scarring with approximately 73% luminal compromise. Stenosis length measured approximately 1.0 cm. The airways distal to the stenosis appeared patent without additional pathology.\n\nTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:\nA CRE balloon was utilized for graduated airway dilation:\n- Initial dilation: 12mm balloon inflated to nominal pressure for 90 seconds\n- Intermediate dilation: 14mm balloon inflated for 90 seconds\n- Final dilation: 16mm balloon inflated for 90 seconds\n\nA total of 3 inflation cycles were performed. Post-dilation inspection demonstrated improvement in luminal patency from approximately 27% to 80% of expected diameter. The mucosa remained intact without significant injury. Topical epinephrine (1:10,000) was applied prophylactically.\n\nSPECIMENS OBTAINED: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None encountered\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE MANAGEMENT:\nThe patient was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Intravenous dexamethasone 8mg was administered to reduce post-procedural airway edema. The patient met discharge criteria and was released with appropriate precautions.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nTracheal granulation tissue with stenosis post tracheostomy decannulation with successful balloon dilation. Airway patency improved from 27% to 80% estimated lumen.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Repeat bronchoscopy with dilation planned in 8 weeks to assess durability of response\n2. Pulmonary function testing prior to repeat procedure for objective assessment\n3. Consider airway stent placement if adequate lumen cannot be maintained with serial dilations\n4. Voice rest for 24 hours, soft diet\n5. Patient instructed to seek immediate medical attention for worsening stridor, respiratory distress, or hemoptysis\n\nProcedure performed by: Dr. B. Martinez\nSupervised trainee: Dr. P. Kumar (PGY-6)\nElectronically signed: 2024-06-17",

Williams\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nExtrinsic bronchial compression with stenosis from mediastinal lymphadenopathy\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nSame\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic balloon dilation (CPT 31630)\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY:\n78-year-old female with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with progressive dyspnea, completed 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Patient reports progressive dyspnea on exertion, recurrent respiratory infections, exercise intolerance.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia\nAIRWAY: ETT (8.0 mm)\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nThe patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and positioned supine. Standard monitoring was applied. After adequate sedation, the bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nFINDINGS:\n- Vocal cords: Normal mobility bilaterally\n- Stenosis identified at proximal left mainstem bronchus\n- Pre-dilation assessment: 63% luminal narrowing\n- Stenosis length: approximately 2.5 cm\n- Stenosis character: complex with granulation tissue\n- Distal airways: Patent and clear\n\nINTERVENTION:\nHurricane balloon advanced to stenosis site under direct visualization.\nSerial dilations performed:\n- 6mm \u00d7 45 seconds\n- 8mm \u00d7 45 seconds\n- 9mm \u00d7 45 seconds\n\nTotal 3 inflations performed.\nPost-dilation patency improved from 63% to approximately 35% residual narrowing.\nNo significant mucosal injury or bleeding.\nTopical epinephrine 1:10,000 applied prophylactically.\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<5 mL)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nDISPOSITION:\n- Patient extubated and recovered in PACU\n- Admitted for overnight observation\n- Dexamethasone 10mg IV administered post-procedure\n\nIMPRESSION:\nExtrinsic bronchial compression with stenosis from mediastinal lymphadenopathy successfully treated with balloon dilation. Airway patency improved from 37% to 65%.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Repeat bronchoscopy with dilation in 6 weeks\n2. Pulmonary rehabilitation referral\n3. PFTs prior to next procedure\n4. Call if worsening stridor, dyspnea, or hemoptysis",

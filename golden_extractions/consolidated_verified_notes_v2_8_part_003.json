PET-avid with SUV 4.5. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (CPT 31632), Endobronchial Blocker Placement\nATTENDING: Dr. Patricia Williams\nASSISTANT: Dr. David Lee, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jessica Brown\nRT: Anthony Garcia\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: SuperDimension Navigation System, Olympus BF-1TH190 bronchoscope, 1.9mm cryoprobe, 7Fr Arndt endobronchial blocker\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 30 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nVentilation Parameters:\n\nMode: Volume Control\nRR: 12\nTV: 500mL\nPEEP: 5 cmH2O\nFiO2: 40%\nFlow Rate: 50 L/min\nPmean: 15 cmH2O\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the SuperDimension system. CT scan from 9/10/2024 was loaded onto the planning station to generate 3D rendering. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified, then loaded into the navigation platform.\nEMN Registration: Automatic registration was used. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at carina, right main carina, and RLL subsegmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 4.2mm. Global alignment quality: excellent.\nThe EMN catheter was advanced under navigational guidance to the target lesion in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (RB9). Target lesion measured 2.8cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 0.8cm from the planned target.\nRadial EBUS Survey: Performed to confirm nodule location. The following features were noted: Concentric pattern, heterogeneous echogenicity, lesion size 27mm, no large vessels visualized in the biopsy path.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy: After confirming absence of significant vessels at the biopsy site with radial EBUS, transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed using a 1.9mm cryoprobe. Freeze-thaw cycle: 6 seconds freeze, passive thaw. After each sample was obtained, the Arndt endobronchial blocker was positioned at the RLL ostium and inflated with 6cc of air for hemostasis. Total 4 samples were collected.\nAfter each biopsy, the blocker was maintained for 2 minutes, then deflated. Inspection showed minimal bleeding, which resolved spontaneously. Final inspection showed patent airways with no active bleeding.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Williams, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nRLL cryobiopsy x4 (histology)\nAdditional tissue for molecular testing\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Johnson underwent successful navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy of RLL nodule. Preliminary frozen section showed atypical cells, final pathology pending. Post-procedure CXR shows no pneumothorax. Patient to follow up in clinic in 1 week for pathology results.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.\n\nFollowing inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc\n\nRecommendation:\n\u2022 CXR to rule out pneumothorax\n\u2022 Await pathology results\n\nThomas Wright, MD\nInterventional Pulmonary\n\n________________________________________",

Patient receiving immunotherapy, desires to minimize clinic visits and maintain active lifestyle.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Comprehensive informed consent obtained\n- Patient educated on catheter management, drainage technique, and infection prevention\n- Timeout performed with entire procedural team\n- Ultrasound examination: Large right pleural effusion, maximum depth 9.8 cm, free-flowing, no loculations\n- Recent CT chest (5 days ago): No evidence of trapped lung, appropriate candidate for pleurodesis\n- Labs: WBC 5.2K, Platelets 198K (decreased from baseline due to recent chemo)\n- Vital signs: BP 118/68, HR 76, SpO2 93% on RA\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n- Patient positioned in left lateral decubitus, comfortable positioning with pillows\n- Right lateral chest, 5th intercostal space, mid-axillary line identified\n- Site marked with ultrasound guidance, safe window confirmed\n- Chlorhexidine prep, sterile drape placement\n- Local anesthesia: 18 mL 1% lidocaine along planned tract\n- Small 1 cm incision with #11 blade\n- Tunneling performed to anterior chest wall (tunnel length 7.5 cm)\n- Tunneling device used to create tract\n- Guidewire placed under direct ultrasound visualization\n- 15.5 French PleurX catheter advanced over wire smoothly\n- Catheter tip positioned and confirmed to be coiled in pleural space\n- Safety suture placed, cuff in appropriate subcutaneous position\n- Valve connector attached\n- Initial drainage via vacuum bottles: 1,550 mL clear yellow fluid\n- Drainage well tolerated, no re-expansion symptoms\n- Post-drainage ultrasound: minimal residual fluid, good lung expansion\n\n**CATHETER SPECIFICATIONS:**\n- Type: PleurX drainage catheter system\n- French Size: 15.5 Fr\n- Tunnel length: 7.5 cm\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural fluid cytology (initial drainage specimen)\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Procedure completed successfully\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: IPC in excellent position, near-complete drainage of effusion, no pneumothorax\n- Sterile dressing applied per protocol\n- Comprehensive teaching session with patient and spouse (1.5 hours)\n- Patient demonstrated proper drainage technique with return demonstration\n- Home health referral placed for first week support\n- Written instructions and video resources provided\n- Emergency contact information given\n- Drainage supplies dispensed (vacuum bottles, dressing supplies)\n- Vital signs: BP 116/66, HR 72, SpO2 97% on RA\n- Patient very pleased with symptomatic relief\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DRAINAGE SCHEDULE:** Every other day initially, will reassess based on output volumes\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Successful ultrasound-guided placement of right indwelling pleural catheter for management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion. Excellent initial drainage with good lung expansion. Reasonable expectation for spontaneous pleurodesis given no trapped lung and good lung expansion.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Drainage every other day initially\n- Record all drainage volumes in provided log\n- Home health visits first week for catheter assessment and drainage assistance\n- Monitor for signs of spontaneous pleurodesis (decreasing volumes to <50 mL per drainage session)\n- Report fever, increasing redness/drainage at site, catheter malfunction, or worsening dyspnea\n- Follow-up clinic visit in 3 weeks\n- Continue immunotherapy as scheduled (cleared by oncology)\n- If pleurodesis achieved (minimal drainage x 2 consecutive drainages), schedule catheter removal\n- Patient given 24/7 contact number for concerns",

Right-sided pleural effusion causing moderate dyspnea.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Informed consent obtained with discussion of increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia (platelets 68K) and coagulopathy (INR 1.7)\n- Timeout performed\n- Point-of-care ultrasound revealed right pleural effusion, maximum depth 6.5 cm\n- Labs reviewed: Platelets 68K, INR 1.7, Creatinine 1.2\n- Vital signs: BP 118/72, HR 76, SpO2 91% on 2L NC\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n- Patient positioned sitting, leaning forward\n- Right lateral chest, 7th intercosal space, posterior axillary line\n- Chlorhexidine skin prep\n- Local anesthesia: 12 mL of 1% lidocaine\n- Ultrasound-guided insertion of 8-French catheter system\n- Initial fluid: transudative appearance, clear yellow\n- Volume removed: 800 mL (stopped due to concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema)\n- Drainage rate kept slow (less than 1000 mL/hour)\n- Post-procedure ultrasound: no pneumothorax\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural fluid analysis (cell count, protein, LDH, albumin)\n- Pleural fluid culture\n\n**IMMEDIATE RESULTS:**\n- Appearance: Clear, yellow, transudative\n- Estimated protein <2.5 g/dL based on appearance\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Procedure well tolerated\n- No immediate complications\n- Vital signs: BP 122/74, HR 78, SpO2 94% on 2L NC\n- Patient reports significant improvement in breathing\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Successful therapeutic thoracentesis of recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. Limited drainage to 800 mL to minimize risk of complications given underlying coagulopathy and hepatic disease.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Continue diuretic optimization\n- Discuss with hepatology regarding TIPS evaluation\n- Consider repeat thoracentesis vs IPC if rapid reaccumulation\n- Sodium restriction and fluid management",

After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\n\nOf note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer patient back to ward room\n\u2022 Await final pathology results\n\u2022 Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy\n\nI, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.\n\n________________________________________",

RADIAL EBUS CONFIRMATION: Radial probe advanced through Ion working channel. Ultrasound pattern: Concentric (lesion surrounds probe). Lesion size by REBUS: 28mm. Position confirmed within target. CONE BEAM CT: CBCT spin performed. NaviLink 3D fusion confirmed catheter position within lesion with 2mm margin from lesion center. Excellent alignment. SAMPLING: \u2022\tBrush cytology x2 samples (via guide sheath) \u2022\tForceps biopsy x4 samples (via guide sheath) \u2022\tNeedle aspiration x2 samples (21G) ROSE: Not available COMPLICATIONS: None No pneumothorax on post-CBCT imaging ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5mL SPECIMENS: Cytology, histology sent to pathology IMPRESSION: Successful robotic navigation and sampling of RUL nodule. Awaiting final pathology.

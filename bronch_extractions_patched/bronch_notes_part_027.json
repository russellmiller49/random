The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n \nPROCEDURE:  \n31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode\n31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    \n31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)\n31630 Balloon dilation\n \n \nATTENDING:  \nDuane Johnson MD PhD\n \nASSISTANT:   none\n \nSupport Staff: \nRN: Lyndsey Elmer\nRT: Mandy Malone\n \nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n \nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n \nINSTRUMENT : \nDisposable Bronchoscope\n \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None\n \nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n \nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. \n \nPATIENT POSITION: . \n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. \n \nEndobronchial biopsy was performed at Bronchus Intermedius .  Two areas were biopsied with NBI guidance.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.\n \nStents are in good position.  The (iCAST 7x16) was noted in the right lower airway.  (iCAST 5x16) was noted in the right middle lobe airway. \n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at RLL.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).\n \nBalloon dilation was performed at RB2 orifice.  5mm mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 5mm at the RB2.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.\n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nEBBX\nBAL RLL\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Nira Kaplan is a 85 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for airway narrowing.\n- f/u in clinic\n- f/u in 12 weeks for bronch evaluation of stent\n \nDuane Johnson , MD, PhD\n12/15/2025",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n \n1899 Unlisted Procedure (Trach Change with Mature Tract or Procedure NOS)\n31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode\n31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)\n31630 Balloon dilation\n31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)\n \n22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required) and XS Separate Structure, a service that is distinct because it was performed on a separate organ/structure\n \nIP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: \nUnusual Procedure (22 MODIFIER):\nThis patient required multiple forms of ablative therapy (soft coag and cryotherapy) to multiple different structures, including glottis, infraglottis, subglottis, and tracheal structures. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, Severity of patient's condition, and Physical and mental effort required.

Sedation initiated.  LMA placed.\n \nThe Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination.  Endobronchial topical lidocaine applied to the vocal cords and larynx.\n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nVocal cords with appropriate adduction/abduction.\n \nLarge patch of papillomas at anterior commissure of larynx and right vocal cord.\n \nProximal trachea with focal area of spiraling tissue creating a focal area of mild stenosis - about 20% stenosis prior to treatment.  Able to easily traverse area of mild stenosis with therapeutic bronchoscope without issue.\n \nAssessment of right airways revealed normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level.  Otherwise no evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\n \nAssessment of left airways revealed normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology  \n \nVC papilloma are treated with combination of cryospray, electro-cautery (PreciSect/softcoag), and mechanically debulking. \n \nEndobronchial papillomatous tumors at proximal trachea, subglottic region, infraglottic region, left vocal fold, and anterior commissure were treated with the following modalities. \n \nThe base of all patch sites were treated with cryotherapy.\n \nModality\tTools\tSetting/Mode\tDuration\tResults\nCryospray\t2.3 mm catheter\tNormal flow, Freeze\t5 sec burst\tTumor frozen, 5 sites 3-5 treatment each\n \n \nEndobronchial tumor and coagulated debris was noted and excised with mechanical debridement using alligator forceps. Send to path and microbiology.\n \nRigid tracheoscope was used to dilate the proximal tracheal obstruction.  Mechanically coring through the tumor.  Black non-ventilating scope was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 300 seconds each.\n  \nCryospray was done at the tumor site proximal trachea for 2 different sites.  Total 3-5 treatments with 5 seconds of freeze at Normal flow was completed for both sides.   \n \nPrior to treatment, proximal trachea airway was note to be 40% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. \n \nThroughout the procedure, careful attention was paid to suction any secretions and blood to prevent it falling into the distal trachea or more distal airways.\n \nResidual secretions and blood were suctioned to clear.  Video imaging obtained and saved.  Bronchoscope removed.\n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient had airway device removed in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Trivial\nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nTrachea biopsy:  Pathology\n \n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Arvin T Hsu is a 49 year old-year-old adult who presents for bronchoscopy for blation of papillomatous tumors in the context of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.\n \n-Recommend repeat bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks to reassess recurrence of papillomas and consideration of additional treatment.\n \n \n \nDuane Johnson , MD, PhD\n12/15/2025",

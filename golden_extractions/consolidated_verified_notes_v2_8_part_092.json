CT showed subglottic stenosis with 70% narrowing.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nPatient brought to OR, placed under general anesthesia with jet ventilation. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed circumferential web-like stenosis 2cm below vocal cords with 65-70% luminal obstruction. Sequential balloon dilation performed using CRE balloon dilator, starting at 10mm, progressed to 12mm, then 14mm over three cycles. Each inflation held for 60 seconds at 8 ATM. Post-dilation exam showed adequate lumen restored to approximately 90% patency. No mucosal tears. Minimal bleeding controlled with observation.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nEBL: <5mL\nDISPOSITION: PACU, planned same-day discharge\n\nPLAN: Repeat bronchoscopy in 6-8 weeks. Discuss stent if recurrence.

Bronchus intermedius stenosis\n2. History of RLL sleeve resection for carcinoid tumor\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same, s/p successful dilation\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:\n1. Flexible bronchoscopy\n2. Balloon dilation of bronchus intermedius\n\nINDICATIONS: 72 y/o female with history of RLL sleeve resection 18 months ago, presenting with progressive dyspnea and recurrent right lower lobe pneumonias. CT demonstrates 70% stenosis at surgical anastomosis.\n\nANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation with midazolam 3mg and fentanyl 75mcg IV\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\nPatient placed in supine position with standard monitoring. Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) introduced through right nare. Vocal cords normal mobility. Trachea and carina normal. LMS and left bronchial tree unremarkable. RMS patent. At bronchus intermedius, severe circumferential stenosis noted at anastomotic site with approximately 65-70% obstruction. Pinhole opening visualized. Sequential balloon dilation performed: 8mm x 20mm CRE balloon (2 inflations x 45 sec at 4 ATM), then 10mm x 20mm balloon (2 inflations x 60 sec at 6 ATM), finally 12mm balloon (1 inflation x 60 sec at 6 ATM). Post-dilation patency estimated at 80-85%. RLL basilar segments now visible and patent. Minimal bleeding, resolved spontaneously.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nSPECIMENS: None\nEBL: <5mL\n\nIMPRESSION:\nSuccessful balloon dilation of post-surgical anastomotic stenosis at bronchus intermedius\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Continue current antibiotics for recent pneumonia\n2. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 8 weeks\n3. Consider stent placement if recurrent stenosis\n\nLisa Wang, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology",

Progressive dyspnea with near-complete RUL obstruction. Palliative debulking requested.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nGeneral anesthesia with rigid bronchoscope ventilation. Large exophytic tumor at RUL orifice causing 80% obstruction with extension into bronchus intermedius. Cryotherapy performed using Erbe Erbokryo CA unit with flexible cryoprobe. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles applied to tumor surface:\n- RUL orifice: 4 cycles, 30 sec freeze each\n- Bronchus intermedius tumor extension: 3 cycles, 30 sec each\n\nSignificant tumor necrosis achieved. Necrotic tissue debrided with rigid suction. Post-procedure patency improved to approximately 50% at RUL, BI now 80% patent. Moderate bleeding controlled with cold saline and topical epinephrine.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Moderate bleeding, controlled\nEBL: ~75mL\n\nIMPRESSION: Successful palliative cryotherapy debulking\nPLAN: Repeat bronchoscopy in 1 week for additional debulking.

Stent removed 2 months ago. Surveillance bronch shows recurrent granulation tissue at prior stent margins causing 50% stenosis.\n\nPROCEDURE:\nModerate sedation (propofol infusion). Flexible bronchoscopy via oral route. RMS with circumferential granulation tissue at 2cm from carina, 50% obstruction. LMS normal. Cryotherapy (spray cryotherapy, CSA Medical TrueFreeze) applied to granulation tissue:\n- Anterior wall: 3 applications x 5 seconds each\n- Posterior wall: 3 applications x 5 seconds each  \n- Lateral walls: 2 applications each side x 5 seconds\n\nImmediate tissue blanching and edema noted. Post-treatment lumen slightly improved. Expected further improvement with tissue sloughing over 1-2 weeks.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nEBL: Minimal\n\nPLAN: Repeat bronchoscopy in 2 weeks to assess response and debride necrotic tissue. Consider balloon dilation if stenosis persists.\n\nE. Thompson, MD",

Small cell lung cancer with endobronchial disease\n2. Right upper lobe bronchus obstruction\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same, s/p palliative cryotherapy\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:\n1. Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Cryotherapy ablation of endobronchial tumor\n3. Mechanical debridement\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY: 75 y/o female with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Despite chemotherapy, progressive endobronchial disease causing RUL collapse and post-obstructive pneumonia. Palliative bronchoscopic intervention requested.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with jet ventilation\n\nFINDINGS:\nRigid bronchoscopy introduced. Trachea patent. Carina sharp. LMS and left bronchial tree normal. RMS with tumor extending from RUL orifice, completely occluding RUL takeoff and causing 60% narrowing of bronchus intermedius. Tumor is friable, necrotic centrally.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n1. Cryotherapy (Erbe Erbokryo) applied to tumor bulk:\n   - RUL orifice: 6 freeze-thaw cycles (30 sec freeze/15 sec thaw)\n   - BI extension: 4 cycles\n2. Mechanical debridement using rigid suction and forceps\n3. Tumor core extracted en bloc\n\nRESULT: RUL orifice now 40% patent (was 0%). BI improved to 90% patency. Significant tumor burden removed. Active bleeding controlled with cold saline lavage.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Moderate bleeding (controlled)\nEBL: 100mL\n\nSPECIMENS: Tumor fragments sent to pathology\n\nDISPOSITION: ICU overnight monitoring\n\nPLAN:\n1. Chest X-ray post-procedure\n2. Continue IV antibiotics\n3. Repeat bronchoscopy in 5-7 days\n4. Oncology follow-up for additional chemotherapy\n\nMichael Nakamura, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

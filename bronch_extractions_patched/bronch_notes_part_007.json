    "note_text": "Indications: Lung mass\nMedications: General Anesthesia\nConsent was obtained from the patient\u2019s father prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nThe patient had been previously intubated for proceeding procedure. The UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, into the esophagus. Using the vascular anatomy the bronchoscope was directed to the area of the known paraesophageal mass abutting the aorta just below the left atrium.  The mass was well-visualized with ultrasound directly behind the aorta with a small window which the needle could be passed between the left atrium and aorta. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUS TBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation was non-diagnostic after multiple attempts.  We then removed the EBUS bronchoscope. The endotracheal tube was removed and a size I-Gel LMA was inserted. The P190 thin video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Within a subsegment of the posterior basal branch of the left lower lobe and normal-appearing endobronchial mucus was seen overlying the orifice. The radial EBUS probe was inserted into the segment and a concentric lesional view was obtained. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include needle forceps and brush. A BAL was then performed in the segment. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. Samples were sent for cytology and culture. \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 5cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful EUS-B biopsy and radial probe biopsy of lung mass \n- Will await final pathology and culture results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11Rs lymph node.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE was showed benign lymphocytes. Subsequently the EBUs bronchoscope was removed and the therapeutic Q180 video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway. A guide sheet was inserted into the superior segment of the right lower lobe under fluoroscopic visualization and radial EBUS was advanced through the guide sheet to visualize the known lung mass. The radial probe was removed and peripheral TBNA needle was inserted through the guide sheath under fluoroscopic visualization to sample the right lower lobe mass. A total of 5 needle biopsies were obtained. Preliminary ROSE did not show malignancy but abundant inflammatory cells were seen suspicious for lung abscess.  Using fluoroscopy we then performed a total of 6 forceps guided biopsies through the guide sheath for tissue evaluation and culture followed by mini-lavage in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results\n- Will empirically start on Augmentin for treatment of suspected lung abscess.",

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nThe patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position, and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by ultrasound in the left 8th rib space. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nAn 18-gauge, 5 cm long echogenic percutaneous entry needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space, and fluid was aspirated to verify placement. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the needle, and the needle was then withdrawn. A 1.5 cm incision was made through the skin, and a 14 Fr dilator was advanced into the pleural space over the wire.\nThe dilator was removed, and gentle dissection with Kelly forceps was performed alongside the wire until the pleural space was entered. A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 8th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid, resulting in the removal of approximately 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe pleura had diffuse carcinomatosis, and thick adhesions were present with tethering of the lung to the chest wall. The 5 mm port was removed, and an 8 mm port was inserted in the same fashion through the original entry point. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture, with approximately five total biopsies taken. There was mild bleeding associated with the biopsies. An additional 375 cc of sanguineous fluid was then removed with suction applied through the port. Repeat examination of the pleural space showed residual bleeding had subsided.\nThe pleuroscopy telescope was then removed. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the port, and the port was withdrawn. A 14 Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain and pigtail straightening obturator were inserted into the pleural space over the wire. The obturator and wire were removed, and the drain was then immediately connected to a Pleur-Evac via the connecting tubing adapter. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and tidaling. The incision was then sutured into place with subcuticular 0 silk suture. Once the air leak had subsided, a chest X-ray was performed, which showed lung re-expansion. The chest tube was then removed, and the site was dressed with Steri-Strips, gauze, and Tegaderm.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed lung re-expansion and minimal residual effusion.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 20 cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion\nSpecimens:\n\u2022\tPleural fluid- 1275 cc (sent for cytology and microbiological analysis)\n\u2022\tPleural biopsies- 5 (sent for pathology and culture)\nRecommendation:\n\u2022\tAwait pathology and microbiological studies.\n\u2022\tSuture removal in 2 weeks.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. Blood was seen within the right main-stem and gently suctioned. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Obvious sub-mucosal infiltration of tumor was seen through the bronchus intermedius extending into the right middle lobe. The right upper lobe was obstructed from combination extrinsic compression and sub-mucosal infiltration. Blood was seen slowly oozing from the right upper lobe. The right lower lobe bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions. The left sided airways had normal bronchial mucosa and anatomy; without endobronchial lesions.   The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the 4R lymph node which was a conglomerate of nodes extending into the station 10R . Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed  with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Near the end of the procedure the patient became significantly tachycardic and hypotensive with new onset A. fib with RVR.  The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and the Q190 video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. Cardiology was called to the bedside and decision was made for bedside cardioversion which was successful in terminating the rhythm for a short period however she subsequently returned to atrial flutter but with a more controlled rate.  After awakening the patient had difficulty with oxygen saturation for a few minutes and we reintroduced the bronchoscope through the nasal passage to evaluate for evidence of of active bleeding within the airway, none was seen.  The patient was then transferred to the ICU for observation status post cardioversion in good condition.\n\nComplications: Intraoperative atrial fibrillation with RVR\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n-New onset atrial fibrillation\nRecommendations\n- Will await final pathology results\n- We\u2019ll discuss with radiation oncology early treatment to right upper lobe given active hemoptysis.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Left proximal left mainstem was normal. There was submucosal tumor infiltration in the distal 3 cm of the left mainstem circumferentially. The left lower lobe was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor. The left upper lobe orifice was approximately 70% obstructed with tumor and the LC1 carina was infiltrated with tumor. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7, 4L lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 7 Lymph node, followed by the 4L lymph node. ROSE evaluation yielded benign lymphocytes in the station 7 and scant lymphocytes in station 4L. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\nDecision was made to not proceed with mediastinoscopy as the left mainstem and upper lobe disease would preclude previously considered surgical resection and treatment would not be effected by the presence of N2 disease. \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 5cc\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results\n- Will present at tumor board for consideration of chemo-rads",

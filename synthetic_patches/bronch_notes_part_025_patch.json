Following therapeutic aspiration of secretions from the Trachea, Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius, the Ion platform was utilized to navigate to the anterior segment of the RUL. Localization was confirmed via Cone Beam CT (CBCT) and Radial EBUS. A diagnostic TBNA was performed. Subsequently, therapeutic microwave ablation was delivered to the lesion in three overlapping sessions (RB1, RB2, RB3) at 90 degrees Celsius to ensure adequate margins. Post-ablation imaging confirmed successful targeting without complications."

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The patients known Silicone Y-stent was well positioned. There was signifigant thich dry mucous with mild obstruction of the tracheal limb, moderate obstruction of the left bronchial limb and significant obstruction of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease. On the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease. At the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time. Through a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents. Subsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Discharge once criteria met.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via an 8.5 ETT  and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The distal trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The Covidien superDimension locatable guide was then inserted through the working channel and registration was performed. The Edge 180 degree extended working channel was then attached to the bronchoscope.  Using navigational map we advanced the catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a diffuse heterogeneric concentric view within the lesion consistent with the known part solid nodule. Biopsies were then performed with peripheral needle under fluoroscopic visualization with ROSE findings consistent with malignancy, additional forceps biopsies were then performed in the same location.  \nThe flexible bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced via the ETT. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4L, 7 and 4R lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUS TBNA 22- and 25-gauge needles beginning with the 4L Lymph node (7 biopsies), followed by the 7 lymph node (5 biopsies) and finally the 4R lymph node (4 biopsies). ROSE evaluation was consistent with adequate lymph node sampling in all stations. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the T190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Active oozing was noted at the site of the 4R lymph node and topical iced saline was applied with subsequent resolution of the bleeding and after suctioning remaining  blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\nComplications: No immediate complications\n\u2022\tEstimated Blood Loss: 10 cc\n\u2022\tPost Procedure A/P:\no\tTechnically successful flexible bronchoscopy with peripheral navigation and endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\no\tThe patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\no\tPost- procedural CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.\no\tGiven proximity of biopsy to pleura and plan to fly back to Japan on Thursday will have patient return for repeat CXR tomorrow out of an abundance of caution. \no\tWill await final pathology results.",

Informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol.\nTime-Out:\nA formal time-out was performed confirming the patient\u2019s identity, procedure, and site.\n________________________________________\nI. Initial Airway Inspection\nFindings:\n\u2022\tThe flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the 8.5 ETT and advanced into the trachea.\n\u2022\tThe trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina.\n\u2022\tThe bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level.\n\u2022\tInspection notable for an endobronchial fungating mass in the RUL obstructing the superior and anterior segments.\n\u2022\tThe remaining airways appeared normal with no additional endobronchial abnormalities, mucosal irregularities, or abnormal secretions.\n________________________________________\nII. Tissue Sampling Procedures\nA. Right Upper Lobe (RUL) Endobronchial Biopsy\n\u2022\tAn endobronchial mass was identified obstructing the superior and anterior segments of the RUL.\n\u2022\tSampling Techniques:\no\tTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex transbronchial needle with five (5) passes.\no\tEndobronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with six (6) samples obtained.\no\tHemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine.\nB. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Lesion Biopsy\n\u2022\tA second lesion was identified in the superior segment of the LLL using radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a concentric view.\n\u2022\tSampling Techniques:\no\tTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex with four (4) passes.\no\tTransbronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with five (5) samples obtained.\no\tHemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine.\nC. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) - Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Superior Segment\n\u2022\tA BAL was performed in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.\n\u2022\tInstillation: 110 cc normal saline\n\u2022\tReturn: 20 cc\n\u2022\tSamples sent for cytology, microbiology (bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures), and differential cell count.\nD. Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE)\n\u2022\tRight Upper Lobe (RUL) lesion: ROSE interpretation was malignant.\n\u2022\tLeft Lower Lobe (LLL) lesion: ROSE revealed abundant necrosis but pathology was unable to definitively confirm malignancy.\n________________________________________\nIII. Final Airway Re-Inspection and Conclusion\nFindings:\n\u2022\tNo active bleeding was noted on final airway inspection.\n\u2022\tNo evidence of airway compromise.\nEstimated Blood Loss: Moderate, successfully controlled with topical epinephrine.\nComplications: No immediate complications.\nDisposition/Plan:\n\u2022\tThe patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.\n\u2022\tPost-procedure CXR was performed to rule out pneumothorax or other complications.\n\u2022\tPathology, cytology, and microbiology results are pending.\n\u2022\tFollow-up bronchoscopy and multidisciplinary evaluation will be planned based on final pathology results.",

The risks include but were not limited to bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax. All questions were answered. \nThe patient was anesthetized with topical anesthesia and the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth where topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords and into the trachea. When adequate anesthesia was achieved, the bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and topical lidocaine administered on a local-regional fashion. The endobronchial tree was inspected and patient was found to have endobronchial lesion noted in the right lower lobe superior segment.  Multiple forceps biopsies were obtained at this time.  Lidocaine with epinephrine was instilled in addition to cold saline to achieve adequate hemostasis. ROSE at bedside confirmed adequate sample and possible evidence of malignancy.  The bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn and removed.\nThe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords.  Staging ultrasound performed.  Measured on ultrasound the 11 L, 10 L, for now, 7, 4R, 10 R, 11RS and 11Ri.  Station 7 was greater than 5 mm and therefore was sampled by needle aspiration \u00d74.  ROSE at bedside confirmed adequate sample.  Bronchoscope was slowly withdrawn and removed.\nDiagnostic bronchoscope passed through the vocal cords.  Tracheobronchial tree was examined adequate hemostasis was achieved.  Right lower lobe superior segment endobronchial lesion no longer bleeding.  Bronchoscope was slowly withdrawn and removed.\nComplication: None\nImpression:\n1.  Right lower lobe superior segment endobronchial lesion\n2.  Biopsies of 7 lymph node station\nRecommendations: \n1.  Follow up final pathology of endobronchial lesion\n2.  Will notify patient in regards to follow-up with primary pulmonologist",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\n \nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n \nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate\n \nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n \nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm the patient\u2019s identity, the procedure, and the location.\nFollowing administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were identified on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60\u202fcc of instilled saline, yielding 20\u202fcc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were identified. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4\u202fcc of epinephrine, 30\u202fcc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage.\nThe bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure was completed without further incident. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications. At the conclusion, he was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.\n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nBAL from right lower lobe: Sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, cytology, and galactomannan.\nRight lower lobe forceps biopsy: Sent for pathology and culture.\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Timothy Grace is a 56 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe.\n\u2022\tTransfer to PACU\n\u2022\tObtain chest X-ray\n\u2022\tDischarge home once cleared by PACU\n\u2022\tAwait pathology results.",

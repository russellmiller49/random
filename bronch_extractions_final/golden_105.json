All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 11Rs lymph node which ,measured as 10.4 mm in the short axis dimension. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed within the 11Rs lymph node using an Olympus EBUS TBNA 22 gauge needle. A total of 7 needle passes were performed. All samples were sent for routine cytology. ROSE was suspicious for small cell. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. There was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. Complications: No immediate complications Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc. Post Procedure Diagnosis: Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy. Will await final pathology results.",

Transbronchial needle aspiration was initiated with a 22G needle yielding serous fluid, consistent with a cyst.

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. There were thick greenish mucus plugs throughout the lungs which were easily suctioned. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The scope was advanced into the proximal left upper lobe and a 10mm hypoechoic structure was seen in the area of the 10L lymph node. Within the hypoechoic structure were hyperechoic bands similar to those seen in loculated pleural effusions. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needle and serous appearing liquid was noted within the suction line and attached syringe (approximately 2cc) consistent with cyst. Subsequent pass with an Olympus 19G EBUS-TBNA needle yielded similar results with another 3cc fluid return. Ultrasound showed shrinkage of the cyst. Three additional needle passes were then performed. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed lymphocytes within the samples. Samples and fluid were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. Complications: No immediate complications Post-operative diagnosis: Hilar cyst (bronchogenic vs cardiac) Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc Recommendations: - Transferred patient to post-procedural monitoring unit and discharge when standard criteria are met. - 5 day course of Augmentin to reduce likelihood of infection of residual cystic space. - Will await final pathology results",

Pre-operative diagnosis: hilar adenopathy Post-operative diagnosis: malignant hilar adenopathy Medications: General Anesthesia, Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station 11Ri lymph node. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. Complications: No immediate complications Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc. Post Procedure Diagnosis: Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies. The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit. Will await final pathology results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal with the exception of partial extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe bronchus distal to the lingual and most obvious in the apical segment; there are no endobronchial lesions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The scope was advanced into the proximal left upper lobe and a 45mm heterogeneous cyst with multiple septations was seen just distal to the left PA. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 19G Visioshot EBUS-TBNA needle. Material was thick which could not be grossly aspirated through the needle with attached suction. Samples showed thick coagulated bloody material on multiple needle passes consistent with old blood. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed heme and multiple foamy macrophages. Samples and fluid were sent for both culture and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. Complications: No immediate complications Post-operative diagnosis: Hemorrhagic Hilar cyst Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc Recommendations: - Transferred patient to post-procedural monitoring - 10 day course of Augmentin to reduced likelihood of infection of capsulated cystic space. - Will await final pathology results - Repeat CT in 3-4 weeks or earlier if fevers, persistent/worsening chest pain, hemoptysis or other symptoms concerning for infection or cyst rupture. - Will likely require unroofing and resection with thoracic surgery",

    "note_text": "Indications: Left lower lobe nodule Medications: General Anesthesia, Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the 7.5 ETT. The airways were friable and significant blood was present from difficult intubation. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just distal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we were able to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the anterior-medial segment on the left lower lobe and navigated to within 1cm of the lesion. The navigational probe was then removed and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded a concentric view affirming the location. Needle biopsies were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE was non-diagnostic. The catheter was repositioned to sample other areas of the lesion and radial probe continued to show a concentric view of the tumor. ROSE again was read as non-diagnostic. Tissue biopsies were then performed using forceps under fluoroscopic visualization along with brush and triple needle brush biopsies. After samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the diagnostic bronchoscope was re-inserted into the airway. Subsequent inspection did not show evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed from the airway. Following completion of the procedure the patient was noted to lack audible airleak when the ETT balloon was deflated. Given the difficult intubation, anesthesia decided to leave patient intubated and transfer to the ICU to monitor and extubate when deemed appropriate. Complications: None Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc. Post Procedure Diagnosis: Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Will transfer to the ICU and attempt extubation later today. Await final pathology",

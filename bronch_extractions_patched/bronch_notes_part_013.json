The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: Moderate\nTotal sedation medications: Versed 3mg, Fentanyl 75 mcg\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the nose, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. Topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. \nThe patient\u2019s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. During the procedure, the patient did develop some intermittent hypoxia, requiring attachment of the oxygen supply to the bronchoscope working channel for direct tracheal oxygen administration which resolved the hypoxia. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nComplications: None\nRecommendations:\n-RTC 03 Jan 2020 at 1000 with Dr. Trentacosta\n-Plan for stent removal for 'holiday' in MOR 06 Jan 2020 or earlier if symptoms require\n-continue TID nebulized hypertonic saline\n-hold vest physiotherapy\n- The risks and benefits of the procedure to include bleeding, vocal cord injury hypoxia, airway injury and death were all discussed with the patient who had appropriate mental capacity and understanding of the procedure and he wishes to proceed.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the Q190 flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 4 cm proximal to the main carina there was near complete expiratory collapse of the airway which extended into the bilateral mainstem bronchi and bronchus intermedius. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa was boggy throughout, with the exception of the severe dynamic collapse anatomy were otherwise normal with no endobronchial lesions seen to at least the first sub-segments. There was thick purulent secretions within the bilateral lower lobes (likely secondary to chronic post-obstructive pneumonia from severe airway collapse) which were suctioned.  Measurements of the collapsible central airways were obtained. We then removed the LMA. A MAC 3 video laryngoscope (C-MAC) was then used to expose the larynx with a grade 1 view obtained. The customized 15x12x12 Dynamic Y-stent with a tracheal length of 80mm, right mainstem limb of 10mm and left mainstem limb which was collapsed and secured with Freitag forceps was then passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The forceps were opened and once resistance was met indicating the stent had reached the main carina the forceps were removed. Subsequently a 12mm rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope was inserted into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid tracheoscope and the stent required minimal adjustment to seat in the desired location. Once this was completed the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \nPatient was recovering without issues in the PACU and post-procedure chest x-ray was performed which showed some proximal stent migration and the right sided limb appeared to be of inadequate length to ensure stability. CT was then performed which confirmed the inadequate length f the right sided limb. The patient was then subsequently taken back to the operating room where after induction and administration of paralytics a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilation. Using optical forceps we attempted to remove the original Y-stent however the size of the tracheoscope was inadequate and we converted to a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope which allowed us to easily removed the stent with optical forceps. After-resizing the airways an 18x14x14 Dumon tracheal Y-stent was customized to a tracheal length of 80mm right mainstem length of 30mm and left mainstem limb of 40mm. The stent was then loaded into the Novatech Ton stent deployment device.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of flexible forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed a flexible bronchoscopic inspection to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway collapse. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was completed. \nComplications: Return to OR for stent revision\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU and then to wards\n-  Obtain post procedure CXR\n- Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient\u2019s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n- Critical airway posting at bedside. \n- If Oxygen therapy is required, the oxygen should preferentially be humidified to prevent secretions from become increasingly thick and tenacious.\n- Standard pulmonary toilette (IS, ambulation ect) is appropriate. \n- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation is contraindicated as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\n- If clinical visualization of the stent is require, CT scan or bronchoscopy is needed.",

Malignant Central Airway Obstruction 2. Retained/Embedded Metallic airway stent \nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure the patient could be adequately ventilation. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid trachea was free of tumor but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM).  The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway causing approximately 70% obstruction. There were a few small tumor nodules present in the distal trachea mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucous throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive puss was noted distal to the stent primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus and mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe however appeared free of disease. \nAt this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus and was then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge to the stent. APC was used followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We the utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and then gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided in a similar fashion outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. Open which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compressor however was still present. At this point we took our attention to the right sided airway and utilizing APC with the burn and shave technique attempting to re-cannulate the airway with partial success however obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb and 35 mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius.   The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right  mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer PACU\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation given residual disease. \nPatient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.\n- Management of stent related complications were discussed with the in-patient team and a notice for airway management precautions placed above the patients bed. \n- Stent will need to be removed prior to traveling back to Hawaii as removal requires rigid bronchoscopy. Plan to schedule for procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after effects of radiation should be seen).",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without and endoluminal obstruction. On the right there was minimal structuring of the BI . On the left the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded. Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation however due to the proximal obstruction dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a jagwire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we performed APC to the left maintem followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly re-opened but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets however once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture. At this point to protect from major vascular bleeding we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax and in the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition. \nRecommendations:\n-\tPatient to remain intubated tonight \n-\tCT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung.\n-\tAppreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery.\n-\tPlease obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention. \n-\tIf patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight place left side down, intubate right main stem,",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the operating room. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal appearing with minimal mild thick secretions. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and subsegment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem. In the distal mainstem there was circumferential erythema of the airway wall without stenosis. There was purulent secretions in the left upper and lower lobe. Bronchial wash was performed in the left upper lobe for culture.  The left upper lobe airways were not stenotic but had chronic erythematous appearance consistent with radiation changes. The left lower lobe take-off was not stenotic but there was moderate stenosis of the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe and severe stenosis (90%) of the anterior medial segment. No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left. Following inspection we removed the diagnostic bronchoscope and introduced the T180 therapeutic bronchoscope. Our attention to the stenosis within the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe and gentle dilatation was performed with the 6mm Elation dilating balloon with mild improvement in stenosis. The airway wall was friable however and oozed easily. We then attempted to gently dilate the anterior-medial segment by bypassing the obstruction and gently inflating the balloon to partial expansion (<6mm) and pull back through the stenosis. When this was done relatively brisk bleeding developed. We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed. At that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.",

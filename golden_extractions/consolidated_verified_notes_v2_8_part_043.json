Vocal cords and trachea were normal. A friable, obstructing, exophytic tumor was visualized in the right mainstem bronchus with contact bleeding. Multiple endobronchial forceps biopsies were obtained from the right mainstem tumor for histology with good hemostasis after iced saline and brief suctioning. Additional protected brushings were performed from the same lesion for cytology. No BAL, transbronchial lung biopsy, TBNA, EBUS, or therapeutic tumor debulking was performed. Estimated blood loss was <10 mL. The patient was extubated in the procedure room and discharged from PACU in stable condition.",

Multiple 18-gauge core samples were obtained and sent for histology and culture. Immediately after the biopsy, the patient developed dyspnea and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. CT and bedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate right pneumothorax. A large-bore chest tube was placed in the right anterior axillary line, connected to a water seal drainage system with good air evacuation. The patient was admitted for chest tube management. No concurrent bronchoscopy or thoracentesis was performed.",

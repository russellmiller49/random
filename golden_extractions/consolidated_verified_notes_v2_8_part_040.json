The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle bronchi had stent in place with minimal mucous but granulation tissue the distal edge causing 50% obstruction. The right lower lobe bronchi stent was partially obstructed with thick yellow mucous. Using saline flushes and suction we were able to remove mucous. The right middle lobe stent was then grasped with flexible forceps by the proximal string and retracted. The stent was easily removed. There was significant inflammation and malacia at site of previous stent. The bronchoscope was advanced beyond the stenotic segment and the medial and lateral segments were visualized and intact.  The Right lower lobe stent was then removed in a similar fashion to the RML stent without difficulty. In the previous bed there was extensive inflammation and granulation tissue causing >50% obstruction of the airway. The bronchoscope was pushed through the obstruction using saline flushes and the distal basilar segments were visualized and intact. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were debulked with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps. During this process the superior segment of the RLL was visualized with sub-segments intact. There remained significant obstruction and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue using repetitive 30 second freeze thaw cycles. This was performed in a similar manner in the RML. Finally, using an 8-9-10 CRE dilatational balloon we were able to gently dilate the effected bronchi to increased luminal diameter. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful removal of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with significant residual granulation tissue.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- D/C when criteria met\n- Ok to return to Hawaii on Monday if asymptomatic over weekend. \n- Recommend repeat flexible bronchoscopy with pulmonologist at Tripler within the next week to remove debris following cryotherapy. \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight\n- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.\n- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray \n- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea and right sided airways were normal. The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.  At the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.  Distal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.  Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.  All of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.  At this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.  The first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.  The second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.  Finally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.  At this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.  Using flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.  Subsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.  At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.  Then, using a 8–9–10 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.  Cryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.  Finally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue. \nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-        Transfer patient back to the ICU\n-        Post-procedure x-ray\n-        Patient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis.  \nJordan Parks MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

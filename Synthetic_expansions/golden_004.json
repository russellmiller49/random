Significant endobronchial tumor burden was identified in the left mainstem bronchus. Multimodal recanalization was performed utilizing mechanical coring, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation, resulting in restoration of patency. To maintain airway caliber, a 14x60mm silicone stent was deployed. \nCONCLUSION: Successful rigid bronchoscopy with tumor destruction and stent placement.",

Radial EBUS confirmed concentric views at both sites. Transbronchial biopsies and brushings were obtained. Rapid on-site evaluation suggested adenocarcinoma in both lesions, implying synchronous primaries or metastasis. The patient was extubated without complication.",

Airways patent bilaterally. COMPLICATIONS: None ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5mL SPECIMENS: Cytology specimens sent from stations 7, 4R, 10R, 11R. Cell blocks prepared. Tissue sent for flow cytometry and molecular analysis. ROSE INTERPRETATION: Dr. Amanda Foster, Cytopathology POST-PROCEDURE: Patient recovered without difficulty. Vital signs stable.

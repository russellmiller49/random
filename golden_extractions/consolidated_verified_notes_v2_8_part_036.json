Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nSevere extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent. \nRecommendations:\n\u00b7\tTransfer to ICU\n\u00b7\tObtain post procedure CXR\n\u00b7\tTID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent",

Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation\nSURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD\nASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD\nINDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n\u2022\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n\u2022\tAwait final pathology results  \n\u2022\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy. \n \nI Aria Winslow was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure. \n \nAria Winslow MD \nInterventional Pulmonary",

    "note_text": "DATE OF PROCEDURE: 2/11/2025\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION:  Logan Pierce MRN: 62481955 is a 76 year old-year-old male chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a right upper lobe (RUL) nodule.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\n\nATTENDING:  \nSofia Mitchell MD\n\nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nIon Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\tNone\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.\nRobotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1\u202fmm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. \nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n\nSPECIMEN(S): \nTBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.\nBAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nTransfer to PACU\nObtain chest X-ray\nDischarge home once cleared by PACU\nAwait path and culture results and based on findings f/u for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nSofia Mitchell, MD\n2/15/2024",

Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\nPatient brought to IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.\n\nModerate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:\n- Normal larynx and trachea\n- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity\n- Active \"sucking\" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak\n\nINTERVENTION:\nAttempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.\n\nCOMPLICATION:\nImmediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.\n\nMANAGEMENT:\n- Procedure aborted\n- 100% O2 applied\n- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift\n- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted\n- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement\n- Patient stabilized\n\nADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:\nAfter stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.\n- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident\n- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated\n\nFINAL ASSESSMENT:\n- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate\n- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube\n- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE PLAN:\n- ICU admission  \n- Serial CXRs\n- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours\n- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed\n\nPriya Patel, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology\nStanford Medical Center\n\nAttending Note: Complex case with expected high-risk given bullous disease. Appropriate emergency management of complication. Will follow closely. - PP",

    "note_text": "Patient: Jacob Renfield MRN: 73018492\nDATE OF PROCEDURE: December 17 2018\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass with left main-stem obstruction\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy\nSURGEON: Russell Miller, MD \nASSISTANT: Patricia Hogan MD\nINDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction \nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina\u2019s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nAwait tissue diagnosis\nASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.\nIf patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. \nIf obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",

Alpha-1 patients often have basilar predominant disease (unlike smoking-related emphysema)\n2. Valve selection sizing based on CT measurements  \n3. Chartis interpretation and decision-making\n4. Complete vs. incomplete fissure implications\n\nPRE-PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:\n\u2611 Consent obtained and witnessed\n\u2611 Sedation plan reviewed with anesthesia\n\u2611 CT images loaded on workstation\n\u2611 Valves available (multiple sizes)\n\u2611 Chartis system prepared and tested\n\u2611 Fluoroscopy operational\n\u2611 Emergency equipment checked\n\nPROCEDURE WALKTHROUGH:\n\nSTEP 1: Airway Assessment\nFellow performed systematic examination with attending supervision. Appropriate technique demonstrated for complete inspection.\n\nSTEP 2: Chartis Assessment  \nTarget: Left Lower Lobe\n- Catheter advanced to LLL\n- Balloon inflated to create seal at LLL orifice\n- Baseline flow and resistance measured\n- Results: Flow decay to <30mL/min = NEGATIVE CV\nTeaching point: This indicates absent collateral ventilation and favorable for valve therapy\n\nSTEP 3: Bronchial Measurement & Valve Selection\nCT-based measurements reviewed:\n- LB6: 6.8mm diameter \u2192 5.5mm valve selected\n- LB8-10: 5.2mm diameter \u2192 4.0mm valve selected\n\nSTEP 4: Valve Deployment (Fellow performed with guidance)\n- First valve (LB6): Required repositioning due to initial incomplete seal. Good learning opportunity regarding deployment technique.\n- Second valve (LB8-10): Successful first attempt with excellent technique\n- Final bronchoscopy: Both valves well-positioned, complete occlusion confirmed\n\nTEACHING POINTS POST-PROCEDURE:\n1. Valve repositioning is common and not a complication\n2. Visual confirmation of complete lobar occlusion is essential\n3. Post-procedure care including steroid/antibiotic prophylaxis rationale\n4. Expected timeline for symptom improvement (4-6 weeks typically)\n\nFELLOW ASSESSMENT:\nDemonstrated good procedural skills. Area for improvement: Pre-deployment assessment of valve orientation. Overall: Progressing well in BLVR competency.\n\nPATIENT OUTCOME: Tolerated well, stable, admitted for observation per protocol.\n\nMarcus Williams, MD, FCCP\nProgram Director, Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellowship\nTemple University Hospital\nPhiladelphia, PA",

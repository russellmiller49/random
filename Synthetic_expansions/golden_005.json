Under general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl infusions, a bronchoscopic-assisted percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was undertaken. The bronchoscope was introduced via the existing endotracheal tube, withdrawing to the subglottic space to visualize the anterior tracheal wall. A puncture site was selected between the first and second tracheal rings. Following local anesthetic infiltration, the introducer needle was advanced into the tracheal lumen under direct bronchoscopic visualization. The Seldinger technique was utilized to place a J-wire, followed by serial dilation using a 14 French dilator and the Ciaglia Blue Rhino single-stage dilator. A Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube was smoothly inserted. Placement was confirmed bronchoscopically and via capnography. The device was sutured in place without incident.",

Attention was turned to the LLL, where a peripheral lesion was localized utilizing radial EBUS. Transbronchial biopsies and needle aspirations were obtained.

No significant bleeding noted. ═══ RAPID ON-SITE EVALUATION ═══ Cytopathologist: Dr. Rachel Cohen All sampled stations show NON-NECROTIZING GRANULOMAS with multinucleated giant cells. No caseation. No malignancy. No organisms on preliminary AFB stain. INTERPRETATION: Findings most consistent with SARCOIDOSIS ═══ SPECIMENS ═══ □ Cytology: Stations 7, 4R, 10R, 11R (4 vials) □ Cell blocks: Station 7 (1 vial) □ Flow cytometry: Station 7 (1 tube) □ Microbiology: Station 7 • AFB culture (1 vial) • Fungal culture (1 vial) • Bacterial culture (1 vial) ═══ PROCEDURAL DATA ═══ Start time: 1015 End time: 1048 Duration: 33 minutes Needle passes: 9 total Fluoroscopy: Not used EBL: <5mL ═══ COMPLICATIONS ═══ None ═══ POST-PROCEDURE ═══ Patient tolerated well Recovered from sedation appropriately Vital signs stable No respiratory distress Discharged to home after 90-minute observation ═══ ASSESSMENT ═══ 1.        Successful EBUS-TBNA with adequate tissue sampling 2.        ROSE cytology consistent with SARCOIDOSIS (Stage II - bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy) 3.

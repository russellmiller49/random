The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to tunneled pleural catheter placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion, right\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Catheter Placement (CPT 32550)\nATTENDING: Dr. Rachel Green\nASSISTANT: Dr. Paul Anderson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jennifer Martinez\nRT: David Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1%\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, blood pressure\nINSTRUMENT: CareFusion PleurX catheter system, ultrasound machine\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated\nCHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)\n\nHemithorax: Right\nPleural Effusion Volume: Large\nEchogenicity: Anechoic\nLoculations: None\nDiaphragmatic Motion: Diminished\nLung sliding before procedure: Present\nLung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)\nPleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized\n\nThe right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.\nANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract\nEntry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space\nLocation: Mid-axillary line\nProcedure Steps:\n\nA finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.\nSterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).\n\nExit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line\nInitial Drainage:\nThe PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.\n\nFluid Removed: 1200 mL\nAppearance: Serous, straw-colored\n\nPleural Pressures Measured:\n\nOpening: -8 cmH\u2082O\n500ml: -10 cmH\u2082O\n1000ml: -15 cmH\u2082O\n1200ml: -18 cmH\u2082O (stopped due to chest discomfort)\n\nDrainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nPost-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Johnson underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion. Procedure completed without complications. Patient and family educated on catheter care and home drainage protocol. Drainage every other day initially, adjusting based on output. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Home health nursing arranged for first drainage. Patient given written discharge instructions and emergency contact information.",

PET shows SUV 3.2. Nodule location is peripheral in the lateral basal segment. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to robotic navigational bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy using Intuitive Ion System (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Biopsy (CPT 31628), Transbronchial Brushing (CPT 31623)\nATTENDING: Dr. Amanda Roberts\nASSISTANT: Dr. Jason Kim, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Laura Martinez\nRT: Thomas Wilson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Susan Park\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Intuitive Ion Robotic Platform, radial EBUS probe, biopsy forceps, cytology brush\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nVentilation Parameters:\n\nMode: Volume Control\nRR: 12\nTV: 500mL\nPEEP: 5 cmH\u2082O\nFiO\u2082: 40%\nFlow Rate: 50 L/min\nPmean: 14 cmH\u2082O\n\nNavigation Planning:\nCT Chest scan from 9/28/2024 was placed on the separate planning station (Synapse Lung) to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target nodule in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe (LB9). The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform.\nTarget lesion characteristics:\n\nLocation: LLL, lateral basal segment (LB9)\nSize: 1.8cm\nDistance from pleura: 1.2cm\nBronchus sign: Present\n\nIon Registration - Complete:\nRegistration to the pre-procedure CT was completed using automatic methods. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at:\n\nMain carina\nLeft main carina\nLLL segmental carinas\nTertiary bifurcations in LB9\n\nMean fiducial error: 3.8mm\nGlobal alignment quality: Excellent\nNo registration drift observed during the case\nA confidence sweep confirmed stable targeting throughout the planned trajectory with virtual-to-live alignment within acceptable parameters.\nNavigation:\nThe Ion catheter was advanced under navigational guidance through the left mainstem bronchus, into the LLL, and subsequently into the LB9 segment. The robotic system provided real-time feedback with shape sensing technology.\nTarget reached notification appeared when catheter tip was 0.6cm from the planned target center.\nRadial EBUS Confirmation:\nRadial EBUS probe (1.4mm) was passed through the Ion extended working channel to confirm lesion location. The following features were noted:\n\nPattern: Concentric\nEchogenicity: Heterogeneous\nLesion size by REBUS: 19mm\nDistance to pleura: 11mm\nVessel proximity: No large vessels within 5mm\n\nCone-Beam CT Verification:\nMobile C-arm CBCT spin was performed with the Ion catheter in position. Three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed:\n\nCatheter tip within lesion margins\nDistance from lesion center: 4mm\nTrajectory angle: Optimal for sampling\nNo pleural transgression\n\nSampling:\nWith confirmed tool-in-lesion position:\n\nTransbronchial Biopsy: Forceps biopsies obtained through Ion extended working channel. Total 6 samples collected with visible tissue in each specimen.\nBronchial Brushings: Cytology brush advanced to lesion site. Total 2 brush samples obtained.\nAspiration: Catheter aspiration performed for cytology.\n\nAll samples appeared adequate with visible tissue/cellular material. No ROSE available.\nPost-Sampling Inspection:\nThe Ion catheter was withdrawn.

Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.\nWe discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.\nProcedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement\nHow it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.\nThrough the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.\nMultiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.\nAfter biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.\nPathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry\nPatient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.\nFollow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.",

After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.\nInitial Bronchoscopic Survey:\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:\n\nUpper airways: Normal\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\nRight bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions\nLeft bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus\n\nTumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):\n\nLocation: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall\nSize: 1.8cm (longitudinal) \u00d7 0.9cm (circumferential extent)\nMorphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion\nColor: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization\nSurface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance\nObstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing\nDistal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:\nLaser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.\nTreatment Parameters:\n\nWavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)\nPower output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length\nDiffuser length: 2.5 cm\nTotal power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)\nLight dose (fluence): 200 J/cm\u00b2 of diffuser surface\nTreatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)\nCalculation: 200 J/cm\u00b2 \u00f7 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds\n\nLight was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:\n\nLaser energy meter verified consistent power output\nNo visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)\nNo charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)\nPatient hemodynamically stable throughout\nNo arrhythmias or desaturations\n\nPost-Treatment Assessment:\nImmediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.\nLight Precautions Review:\nPost-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:\n\nStrict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum\nWear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors\nGradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing\nEmergency contact information provided\nWritten instructions given\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient Michael Torres 59M MRN 1589403, October 15 2024, Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.",

    "note_text": "Bronchoscopy Note\nPatient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female\nDate: October 17, 2024\nDoc: Dr. Steven Park\nMRN: 1690514\nSo Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.\nBrought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).\nSo here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.\nAfter cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.\nThe distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.\nDid a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.\nRecommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.\nOverall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",

Initial drainage was 1400mL, then decreased to <100mL/day for the past 48 hours. CXR today shows good lung expansion with only minimal residual pleural fluid. No air leak present. Patient is appropriate candidate for pleurodesis.\nConsent: Obtained from patient. Risks discussed include chest pain/discomfort, fever, respiratory distress (rare), failure of pleurodesis requiring repeat procedure.\nPremedication:\n\nMorphine 4mg IV given 30 minutes prior\nAcetaminophen 1000mg PO given 1 hour prior\nOndansetron 4mg IV given for nausea prophylaxis\n\n\nPROCEDURE STEPS:\nStep 1 - Verification (Time: 14:00)\n\nVerified chest tube patency by flushing with 10mL sterile saline\nConfirmed no air leak on water seal\nReviewed most recent CXR with radiologist - confirmed adequate lung expansion\n\nStep 2 - Lidocaine Administration (Time: 14:05)\n\nDrew up 20mL of 1% lidocaine (200mg total)\nAdministered through chest tube slowly over 2 minutes\nClamped tube for 5 minutes to allow lidocaine to distribute\nReleased clamp, allowed to drain\n\nStep 3 - Talc Slurry Preparation (Time: 14:15)\n\nPrepared sterile talc slurry: 4 grams talc powder in 50mL normal saline\nMixed thoroughly in sterile cup until uniform suspension achieved\nDrew up into 60mL catheter tip syringe\n\nStep 4 - Talc Administration (Time: 14:20)\n\nSlowly instilled talc slurry through chest tube over 5 minutes\nFollowed with 20mL normal saline flush to ensure complete delivery\nImmediately clamped chest tube\n\nStep 5 - Position Changes (Time: 14:25 - 15:25)\nPatient rotated through positions every 15 minutes to distribute talc:\n\nPosition 1 (14:25): Supine - 15 minutes\nPosition 2 (14:40): Right lateral decubitus - 15 minutes\nPosition 3 (14:55): Prone (as tolerated) - 10 minutes\nPosition 4 (15:05): Left lateral decubitus - 15 minutes\nPosition 5 (15:20): Return to supine - 5 minutes\n\nTotal dwell time: 60 minutes\nStep 6 - Resumption of Drainage (Time: 15:25)\n\nReleased clamp on chest tube\nConnected back to suction at -20 cmH2O\nImmediate return of approximately 30mL serosanguineous fluid\n\n\nPATIENT TOLERANCE:\nDuring procedure:\n\nVital signs stable throughout\nComplained of moderate chest discomfort (5/10) during position changes\nReceived additional morphine 2mg IV at 14:50\nNo respiratory distress\nOxygen saturation maintained >94% on 2L NC\n\nPost-procedure (2 hours observation):\n\nChest discomfort decreased to 3/10\nNo fever (temp 37.2\u00b0C)\nNo dyspnea\nChest tube draining serosanguineous fluid, approximately 50mL total since unclamping\n\nSPECIMENS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n\nContinue chest tube to suction -20 cmH2O\nMonitor drainage every 4 hours\nPain control: Morphine 2-4mg IV q4h PRN, acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h scheduled\nChest X-ray in AM\nIf drainage <150mL over next 24 hours AND CXR shows no reaccumulation, consider chest tube removal in 48-72 hours\n\nASSESSMENT: Chemical pleurodesis with talc slurry via chest tube completed successfully without complications. Patient tolerated procedure reasonably well with adequate pain control. Will monitor for pleurodesis efficacy over next several days.\nFollow-up Plan:\n\nDaily CXR while chest tube in place\nRemove chest tube when drainage criteria met (typically 2-3 days)\nFollow-up CXR 1 week after chest tube removal\nIf recurrent effusion develops, may consider PleurX catheter placement",

Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.\nRUSHED TO BEDSIDE\nArrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.\nSCOPE FINDINGS:\nETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.\nRIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal\nLEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.\nINITIAL MEASURES:\n\nIced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope\nSome temporary improvement but bleeding continues\nEpi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect\nTranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction\n\nBALLOON TAMPONADE:\nBlood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.\nKept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.\nSecond deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.\nFINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:\nAfter tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.\nSPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)\nPLAN:\n\nICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)\nKeep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning\nReverse any coagulopathy (check labs)\nCTA chest to identify bleeding vessel\nIR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am\nI'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR\nIf rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation\n\nUPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently. IR taking to angio suite. Will follow up later this AM.",

She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:\n\nRight mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung\nMalignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)\nRight malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells\n\nThe patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING\nPre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:\n\nAddress airway obstruction first (most critical)\nFollow with pericardial window creation\nComplete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates\n\nINFORMED CONSENT\nExtensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:\n\nBleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)\nPerforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)\nArrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)\nHypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)\nNeed for ICU care postoperatively (expected)\nMortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)\n\nBenefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.\nAlternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).\nPatient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\n\nRecurrent adenocarcinoma of right lung with endobronchial obstruction (C34.11)\nMalignant pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology (I31.3, C38.0)\nMalignant pleural effusion, right (J91.0)\nRespiratory failure, acute on chronic (J96.20)\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\nSame as preoperative\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n\nRigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial tumor debridement\nElectrocautery and argon plasma coagulation of endobronchial tumor\nBalloon dilation of right mainstem bronchus stenosis\nMetallic airway stent placement, right mainstem bronchus\nFlexible bronchoscopy with inspection and therapeutic aspiration\nSubxiphoid pericardial window creation (performed by CT surgery)\nPericardial biopsy\nTunneled pleural catheter placement, right hemithorax\n\nCPT CODES\n\n31640 (Bronchoscopy with tumor excision)\n31641 (Bronchoscopy with destruction of tumor)\n31630 (Bronchoscopy with dilation)\n31631 (Bronchoscopy with stent placement)\n31645 (Bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration)\n33015 (Pericardial window, subxiphoid)\n32550 (Insertion of indwelling pleural catheter)\n\n\nANESTHESIA DETAILS\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nInduction: Fentanyl 150mcg IV, Propofol 180mg IV, Rocuronium 50mg IV\nMaintenance: Sevoflurane 1.5-2.5% with intermittent propofol boluses, Fentanyl infusion\nAirway: Initial 8.0mm oral endotracheal tube, exchanged to rigid bronchoscope\nMonitoring:\n\nStandard ASA monitors (ECG, NIBP, pulse oximetry, capnography, temperature)\nArterial line - left radial artery\nCentral venous catheter - right internal jugular (placed by anesthesia for access/monitoring)\nTransesophageal echocardiography probe (for pericardial window portion)\nNeuromuscular blockade monitoring\n\nHemodynamics: Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout with MAP 65-85mmHg, HR 75-95 bpm.

After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:\n\nCorrect patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)\nProcedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)\nPositioning (supine throughout)\nAntibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)\nSteroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)\nBlood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)\n\nInitial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.\nInitial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:\nOlympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:\n\nSupraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions\nVocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses\nSubglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis\nTrachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions\nCarina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy\nLeft main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter\nLUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent\nRight main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.\n\nDecision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.\nRigid Bronchoscopy Phase:\nPatient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.\nVentilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.\nThe rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.\nMechanical Debridement:\nUsing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.\nEstimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue\nHemostasis Measures:\nAs expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:\n\nIced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.\nTopical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.\nTranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.\n\nAfter approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.\nElectrocautery:\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.\nTreatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus\nTreatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time\nEffect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis\nArgon Plasma Coagulation:\nAPC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.\nTreatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.\nDuration: 6 minutes active APC time\nResult: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface\nAssessment after debridement:\nRight mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.\nBalloon Dilation:\nBoston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nInflation sequence:\n\nFirst inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nSecond inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nThird inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)\n\nFluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.\nPost-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.\nStent Placement:\nAfter discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.\nStent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length\nDeployment technique:\n\nStent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance\nPositioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus\nFluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views\nSlow, controlled deployment under direct visualization\nPost-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion\n\nPost-stent assessment:\nFlexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.\nFindings:\n\nStent well-positioned, no migration\nExcellent apposition to airway walls\nRUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent\nRML orifice: Visible and patent\nRLL orifice: Visible and patent\nAll segments of right lung now visualized for first time\nSignificant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nExtensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:\n\nRight upper lobe: Approximately 30mL\nRight middle lobe: Approximately 20mL\nRight lower lobe: Approximately 40mL\n\nTotal secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.\nFinal Airway Inspection:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nLeft bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent\nRight main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)\nRUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation\nMinimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent\n\nRigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).\nAirway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM\nEstimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL\nSpecimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)\n\nPART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)\nPatient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.\nTEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.\nSurgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):\n\nSubxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm\nDissection carried down to pericardium\nPericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created\nRush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid\nPericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)\nNo active bleeding from pericardial surface\n19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space\nDrain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction\n\nTEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.\n\nPART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)\nWith patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.\nUltrasound examination (performed by IP team):\n\nRight hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion\nEstimated volume: 1000-1200mL\nAnechoic fluid, no loculations\nCompressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)\n\nPleurX catheter placement:\nStandard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.\nInitial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).\nChest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.\n\nPROCEDURE CONCLUSION\nAll procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.\nPatient Status at Conclusion:\n\nHemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)\nImproved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)\nTEE shows improved cardiac function\nBilateral breath sounds now audible\n\nPatient kept intubated for transport to ICU given length of procedure and concern for post-obstructive pulmonary edema.\nSpecimens Sent:\n\nEndobronchial tumor (histology)\nBronchial secretions (bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures)\nPericardial tissue (histology, cytology)\nPericardial fluid (cytology, chemistry)\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nEstimated Total Blood Loss: 250mL\nFluids Given: 2000mL crystalloid\nUOP: 400mL\nComplications: None intraoperatively\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN\nImmediate (ICU):\n\nExtubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)\nChest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days\nMonitor pericardial drain output\nPleural catheter to drain q3 days initially\nContinue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)\nDVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ\nPPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis\nAggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry\n\nShort-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):\n\nRemove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day\nTransition to floor when stable\nContinue PleurX catheter drainage\nPain control\nPhysical therapy for reconditioning\n\nMedium-term (1-2 weeks):\n\nDischarge with home health for PleurX catheter management\nFollow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray\nDiscuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved\n\nLong-term:\n\nSurveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent\nMonitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)\nMay need stent revision/exchange\nPleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life\n\n\nASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS\nMrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:\n\nNear-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction \u2192 Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent\nCardiac tamponade physiology \u2192 Successfully addressed with pericardial window\nLarge pleural effusion \u2192 Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter\n\nAll procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:\n\nRestored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)\nResolution of cardiac compromise\nControl of pleural effusion\n\nPrognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.\nThe patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT\nI, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.\nThe procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.\nElectronically Signed: David Kim, MD - 10/25/2024 13:05\nBRONCHOSCOPY 10/27/24\nJackson Mary 82F #2145069\nIndication pneumonia not improving on abx, r/o endobronchial lesion\nModerate sedation versed 2mg fent 75mcg\nScope thru nose, lidocaine spray used\nFindings:\nNose/pharynx ok\nCords move normal\nTrachea normal\nR side all patent no lesions\nL side all patent no lesions\nDiffuse thick yellow secretions throughout both lungs\nBAL done LLL 100cc in 80cc out\nSputum cultures sent\nNo lesions seen\nPost bronch CXR no PTX\nImpression: No endobronchial cause for pneumonia, likely bacterial pneumonitis, cultures pending\nPlan: Continue abx, f/u cultures, repeat CXR 48h\nDr. Smith",

Risks discussed including but not limited to: bleeding (1-5%), pneumothorax (1-3%), infection (<1%), mediastinal complications (pericardial/vascular injury <0.1%), need for additional procedures, anesthesia-related complications. Patient expressed understanding and agreed to proceed.\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\nGeneral endotracheal anesthesia administered.\n- Induction: Propofol 200mg, Fentanyl 150mcg, Rocuronium 50mg\n- Maintenance: Sevoflurane, intermittent propofol boluses\n- ETT: 8.0mm at 22cm at teeth\n- Ventilation: Pressure control, Pinsp 18, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE TIMEOUT:**\nPerformed confirming patient identity (verbal + 2 identifiers), procedure planned, site/laterality confirmed, team introductions, equipment availability checked.\n\n**PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:**\n\n**PHASE 1: EBUS-TBNA FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING**\n\nEBUS bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC190F) introduced through ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node survey performed:\n\n**STATION 4R (Right paratracheal):**\n- Size: 22mm x 14mm\n- Ultrasound features: Hypoechoic, heterogeneous, discrete borders\n- Vascular pattern: Central hilar vessels present\n- Elastography: Predominantly hard (strain ratio 8.2, suggesting malignancy)\n- TBNA: 22-gauge needle, 4 passes\n- ROSE: \"Abundant cellularity, malignant cells present, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma\"\n\n**STATION 7 (Subcarinal):**\n- Size: 19mm x 16mm\n- Ultrasound features: Hypoechoic, round, sharp borders\n- Elastography: Firm (strain ratio 6.8)\n- TBNA: 22-gauge needle, 4 passes\n- ROSE: \"Similar malignant cells as 4R, adenocarcinoma\"\n\n**Additional Stations Surveyed but Not Sampled:**\n- Station 10R: 8mm (below size threshold)\n- Station 11R: 6mm (not sampled - diagnostic yield from 4R/7 adequate)\n- Left-sided stations: No enlarged nodes identified\n\n**PHASE 2: ION ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR RLL MASS**\n\nAfter completing EBUS, EBUS scope removed. Ion robotic bronchoscope introduced.\n\n**Navigation Setup:**\nCT chest from 11/30/2024 loaded to Ion platform. 3D reconstruction showed target in RLL posterior basal segment.\n\n**Ion Registration:**\nAutomatic registration performed. Landmarks matched at carina, RLL carina, and segmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 1.3mm (acceptable). No registration drift observed.\n\n**Navigation to Target:**\nIon catheter advanced under navigational guidance to RLL posterior basal segment. Real-time tracking showed tool-to-target distance of 0.7cm at final position.\n\n**Radial EBUS:**\n20MHz probe inserted through Ion extended working channel.\n- Pattern: Concentric (lesion centered around probe)\n- Size: 32mm diameter\n- Characteristics: Heterogeneous echogenicity, irregular margins, no visible vessels in immediate vicinity\n\n**CBCT Confirmation:**\nCone-beam CT spin acquired. NaviLink 3D fusion overlay confirmed catheter tip within lesion borders, 4mm from lesion center.\n\n**Sampling of RLL Mass:**\n- Transbronchial biopsies: 8 specimens obtained via Ion catheter\n- Cytology brushings: 3 specimens\n- Bronchial washing: sent for cytology and microbiology\n\n**ROSE (Peripheral Lesion):**\n\"Adequate samples. Malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma, morphologically similar to lymph node specimens. Recommend molecular testing.\"\n\n**HEMOSTASIS:**\nNo significant bleeding from any biopsy sites. Airways clear.\n\n**PROCEDURE COMPLETION:**\nTotal procedure time: 78 minutes\nEBUS portion: 32 minutes\nIon bronchoscopy portion: 46 minutes\n\nPatient tolerated procedure well. Extubated in OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition, SpO2 98% on 2L NC.\n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** <10mL\n\n**SPECIMENS:**\n1. Station 4R TBNA x 4 passes (cell block + cytology)\n2. Station 7 TBNA x 4 passes (cell block + cytology)\n3. RLL mass TBBx x 8 (formalin, histopathology - **ORDER MOLECULAR TESTING**)\n4. RLL mass brushings x 3 (cytology)\n5. RLL mass washing (cytology, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures)\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**PRELIMINARY FINDINGS:**\n- N2 disease confirmed (stations 4R, 7 both positive for adenocarcinoma)\n- Primary RLL adenocarcinoma confirmed\n- Stage: At least IIIA (T2bN2M0) pending full staging workup\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:**\n1. Recovery room monitoring per protocol\n2. Chest X-ray in 2 hours to rule out pneumothorax\n3. Discharge home same day if stable and CXR clear\n4. Complete staging: Brain MRI, consider bone scan if not covered by PET\n5. Molecular testing: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, PD-L1, broader NGS panel\n6. Multidisciplinary tumor board presentation next week\n7. Medical oncology referral for neoadjuvant therapy discussion\n8. Radiation oncology consultation\n9. Follow-up in IP clinic in 1 week with full pathology results\n\n**CLINICAL IMPRESSION:**\nStage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung (RLL primary with N2 mediastinal involvement). Not a surgical candidate initially. Will likely require neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with consideration for surgery after response assessment vs definitive chemoradiation. Molecular profiling pending.\n\n**ATTENDING STATEMENT:**\nI was present throughout the entire procedure, personally performed the critical portions including EBUS-TBNA and supervised the Ion navigation and sampling. I reviewed all ROSE results in real-time and made all clinical decisions.\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. Nicholas Foster, 12/15/2024 16:42",

PET-avid with SUV 4.5. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (CPT 31632), Endobronchial Blocker Placement\nATTENDING: Dr. Patricia Williams\nASSISTANT: Dr. David Lee, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jessica Brown\nRT: Anthony Garcia\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: SuperDimension Navigation System, Olympus BF-1TH190 bronchoscope, 1.9mm cryoprobe, 7Fr Arndt endobronchial blocker\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 30 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nVentilation Parameters:\n\nMode: Volume Control\nRR: 12\nTV: 500mL\nPEEP: 5 cmH2O\nFiO2: 40%\nFlow Rate: 50 L/min\nPmean: 15 cmH2O\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the SuperDimension system. CT scan from 9/10/2024 was loaded onto the planning station to generate 3D rendering. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified, then loaded into the navigation platform.\nEMN Registration: Automatic registration was used. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at carina, right main carina, and RLL subsegmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 4.2mm. Global alignment quality: excellent.\nThe EMN catheter was advanced under navigational guidance to the target lesion in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (RB9). Target lesion measured 2.8cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 0.8cm from the planned target.\nRadial EBUS Survey: Performed to confirm nodule location. The following features were noted: Concentric pattern, heterogeneous echogenicity, lesion size 27mm, no large vessels visualized in the biopsy path.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy: After confirming absence of significant vessels at the biopsy site with radial EBUS, transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed using a 1.9mm cryoprobe. Freeze-thaw cycle: 6 seconds freeze, passive thaw. After each sample was obtained, the Arndt endobronchial blocker was positioned at the RLL ostium and inflated with 6cc of air for hemostasis. Total 4 samples were collected.\nAfter each biopsy, the blocker was maintained for 2 minutes, then deflated. Inspection showed minimal bleeding, which resolved spontaneously. Final inspection showed patent airways with no active bleeding.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Williams, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nRLL cryobiopsy x4 (histology)\nAdditional tissue for molecular testing\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Johnson underwent successful navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy of RLL nodule. Preliminary frozen section showed atypical cells, final pathology pending. Post-procedure CXR shows no pneumothorax. Patient to follow up in clinic in 1 week for pathology results.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.\n\nFollowing inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc\n\nRecommendation:\n\u2022 CXR to rule out pneumothorax\n\u2022 Await pathology results\n\nThomas Wright, MD\nInterventional Pulmonary\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: James Patterson\nMRN: 4726193\nDate: May 29, 2019\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation (CPT 31641)\n\nSurgeon: Patricia Lee, MD\nAssistant: Marcus Johnson, MD\nIndications: Tracheal obstruction\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\n\nOf note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer patient back to ward room\n\u2022 Await final pathology results\n\u2022 Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy\n\nI, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.\n\n________________________________________",

CT chest shows near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus by endobronchial tumor. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to therapeutic bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left mainstem bronchus obstruction secondary to endobronchial tumor\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy, Endobronchial Tumor Destruction (CPT 31641), Mechanical Tumor Debridement (CPT 31640), Airway Stent Placement (CPT 31631)\nATTENDING: Dr. Michael Anderson\nASSISTANT: Dr. Sarah Kim, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Robert Martinez\nRT: Lisa Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Thomas Wright\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: Storz rigid bronchoscope (14mm), Olympus flexible bronchoscope, Electrocautery (Bovie), APC probe, mechanical debrider, 14mm x 60mm silicone stent (Dumon)\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll\nA rigid bronchoscope (14mm) was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was utilized. A complete airway survey was performed.\nInitial Findings:\n\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nRight mainstem: Patent, mucosa normal\nLeft mainstem: 90% obstructed by friable, hemorrhagic endobronchial tumor starting 1cm distal to the carina and extending 3cm distally\n\nTherapeutic Interventions:\n1. Mechanical Debridement: The tumor was cored using the rigid bronchoscope with mechanical debridement. Multiple passes were required to remove bulk tumor. Estimated tumor volume removed: 15cc.\n2. Electrocautery: Residual tumor base was treated with electrocautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. Total treatment time: 3 minutes. FiO2 maintained at 40% during cautery.\n3. Argon Plasma Coagulation: APC was applied to residual tumor at 40 watts, argon flow 1.5 L/min. Treatment applied circumferentially to tumor base. Duration: 2 minutes.\nResults: Prior to treatment, left mainstem bronchus was 10% patent. After treatment, the airway was 70% patent.\n4. Stent Placement: Due to significant malacia and risk of re-obstruction, a 14mm x 60mm Dumon silicone stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. Stent position confirmed endoscopically with good apposition to airway wall.\nHemostasis was confirmed with minimal oozing controlled with topical epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution, 10mL instilled). A flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid barrel for final inspection showing:\n\nPatent stent lumen\nVisible LUL and LLL orifices through stent\nNo significant bleeding\n\nThe bronchoscope and adjunct instruments were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nEndobronchial tumor debridement (histology)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Chen is a 72-year-old female with squamous cell lung cancer and critical left mainstem obstruction. Successful therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor debridement, cautery, APC, and stent placement. Airway patency improved from 10% to 70%. Patient will require surveillance bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks.

RUL nodule 2.1cm, LUL nodule 1.6cm. Both PET avid (SUV 3.4 and 2.9 respectively). No lymphadenopathy. Patient referred for tissue diagnosis.\n\n**MEDICATIONS:**\nHome meds held per protocol. No anticoagulation.\n\n**PROCEDURE SUMMARY:**\n\nPre-procedure CT (02/28/2025) loaded to Ion system. Dual-target navigation plan created for sequential sampling of RUL and LUL nodules.\n\nPatient received general anesthesia. ETT size 7.5 at 21cm at lips.\n\nVent Settings: VC mode, TV 420mL, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 60%, Flow rate 50L/min, Pmean 12cmH2O\n\n**ION REGISTRATION - COMPLETE:**\nRegistration using automatic method. Landmarks matched: carina, bilateral lobar carinas, segmental bifurcations RUL/LUL. Mean fiducial error 0.9mm. Excellent global alignment. No registration drift observed.\n\n**TARGET 1 - RUL ANTERIOR SEGMENT NODULE:**\n\nIon catheter navigated to RUL anterior segment. Tool-at-target confirmed by:\n- Navigation software showing 0.5cm distance\n- Radial EBUS concentric pattern, 19mm lesion\n- Fluoroscopy AP/lateral projections\n\nSamples:\n- Forceps biopsy x6\n- Brushings x2\n- Washing sent for cytology\n\nROSE: Atypical pneumocytes, favor adenocarcinoma. Final pending.\n\n**TARGET 2 - LUL APICAL-POSTERIOR SEGMENT NODULE:**\n\nCatheter repositioned to LUL. Navigation time from RUL target to LUL target: 8 minutes.\n\nRadial EBUS: eccentric pattern initially, adjusted catheter position, achieved concentric pattern. Lesion 14mm.\n\nSamples:\n- Forceps biopsy x5\n- Brushings x2\n\nROSE: Similar to RUL - atypical cells concerning for malignancy.\n\n**PROCEDURE COMPLETION:**\n\nTotal procedure time: 62 minutes\nTotal navigation time: 47 minutes\nCombined registration + navigation time to first nodule: 18 minutes\n\nHemostasis verified. Airways cleared. Patient extubated successfully, to recovery in stable condition.\n\nPost-op CXR: No pneumothorax\n\n**ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful bilateral lung nodule sampling via robotic bronchoscopy. ROSE suggests possible synchronous primary lung cancers vs metastatic disease. Await final pathology. If malignant, will need PET/CT, brain MRI staging. Discussion at thoracic tumor board.\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:** IP clinic 2 weeks\n\nDr. Christopher Hayes, Attending - electronically signed 03/12/2025 17:20\n**BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NOTE**\n\nPatient Identifier: Williams, Robert D. | 71M | MRN 9284756\nDate of Service: 10/18/2024\nPhysician: Dr. Laura Martinez, Interventional Pulmonology\nFellow Physician: Dr. Ahmed Hassan\n\n**Indication:** LLL nodule 2.8cm, hypermetabolic on PET scan\n\n**Procedure:** Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and radial EBUS\n\n**Consent:** Obtained after discussion of risks including pneumothorax (~2%), bleeding (~1%), infection, need for additional procedures\n\n**Sedation:** Moderate conscious sedation - Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 100mcg IV. Monitoring by RN Sarah Cooper. Vitals stable throughout.\n\n**Procedure Details:**\n\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) introduced via oral route. Initial survey:\n- Oropharynx: unremarkable\n- Larynx: no masses, cords mobile\n- Trachea: midline, patent\n- Carina: sharp\n- Bilateral bronchial trees surveyed - no endobronchial lesions identified\n\nPre-procedure CT from 10/05/2024 used for planning. SuperDimension electromagnetic navigation system employed.\n\n**EMN Planning and Navigation:**\nVirtual pathway created to LLL superior segment nodule. Registration performed automatically with good correlation (8 registration points matched, error <5mm acceptable).\n\nExtended working channel (EWC) placed. EMN locatable guide advanced along planned pathway. Position verified at multiple checkpoints. Distance to target upon final positioning: 0.8cm.\n\n**Radial EBUS:**\n1.4mm radial probe advanced through EWC. Ultrasound demonstrated:\n- Concentric hypoechoic lesion\n- Irregular borders\n- Size approximately 26mm\n- No visible vessels within sampling trajectory\n\n**Tissue Acquisition:**\nThrough guide sheath (after probe removal):\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies x 6 (sent to pathology in formalin)\n- Cytology brush specimens x 3 (sent to cytology)\n- Bronchial washing (sent for culture and cytology)\n\nNo immediate bleeding. Gentle suctioning applied.\n\n**Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**\nCytotechnologist present. Preliminary read: \"Adequate cellularity. Malignant cells present consistent with adenocarcinoma. Recommend full cell block for molecular testing.\"\n\n**Post-Procedure:**\nPatient tolerated procedure well. No desaturation. Maintained SpO2 >95% on 2L NC throughout. No complications.\n\nPortable CXR ordered - will check prior to discharge.\n\n**Specimens Sent:**\n1. TBBx x6 (histopathology)\n2. Cytology brushings x3\n3. Bronchial washing (microbiology and cytopathology)\n\n**Impression:** Successful EMN bronchoscopy with biopsy of LLL nodule. ROSE positive for malignancy. Await final pathology and molecular testing for treatment planning.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Discharge home today if CXR negative\n- Full staging workup (brain MRI, PET/CT if not recent)\n- Return to clinic in 1 week for pathology review\n- Referral to medical oncology and thoracic surgery for multidisciplinary evaluation\n\nLaura Martinez, MD - 10/18/2024",

Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.\n\nWe subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\n\nAt this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.\n\nPost-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to ICU\n\u2022 Obtain post-procedure CXR\n\u2022 TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent\n\nLaura Bennett, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Patient has undergone 5 therapeutic thoracenteses over past 8 weeks with rapid reaccumulation. Failed prior attempt at chemical pleurodesis due to trapped lung on CT imaging.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Extensive informed consent discussion including alternative options (indwelling catheter vs repeated thoracentesis)\n- Patient educated on catheter care and drainage protocol\n- Timeout performed per institutional protocol\n- Point-of-care ultrasound: Right pleural effusion, maximum depth 10.8 cm, anechoic, no septations\n- CT chest reviewed: evidence of visceral pleural thickening suggesting trapped lung - patient counseled regarding lower likelihood of spontaneous pleurodesis\n- Labs reviewed: WBC 6.8K, Platelets 178K, INR 1.0\n- Vital signs: BP 126/74, HR 82, SpO2 91% on RA\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n- Patient positioned in left lateral decubitus position\n- Right hemithorax, 6th intercostal space, anterior axillary line selected\n- Ultrasound-guided site marking\n- Chlorhexidine prep, maximal sterile barrier precautions\n- Local anesthesia: 22 mL 1% lidocaine along entire planned tract\n- Small incision made with #15 blade\n- Subcutaneous tunnel created from insertion site to anterior chest (6.5 cm tunnel length)\n- Catheter tunneling device used\n- Guidewire advanced under ultrasound visualization\n- 15.5 French PleurX catheter advanced over wire\n- Catheter position confirmed - appropriate coiling in pleural space\n- Safety suture placed, Dacron cuff in proper position\n- Catheter secured to skin\n- Valve attached\n- Initial therapeutic drainage: 1,450 mL clear yellow fluid via vacuum drainage system\n- Patient tolerated drainage well, no chest discomfort\n\n**CATHETER SPECIFICATIONS:**\n- Type: PleurX drainage catheter (Becton Dickinson)\n- French Size: 15.5 Fr\n- Tunnel length: 6.5 cm\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural fluid chemistry (as baseline)\n- Pleural fluid cytology\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Procedure completed successfully without complications\n- Post-procedure portable chest X-ray: IPC in good position with tip in costophrenic angle, small residual effusion, no pneumothorax\n- Dressing applied per protocol\n- Extensive patient and family education completed by IP nursing team\n- Demonstration and return demonstration of drainage technique\n- Patient verbalized understanding\n- Home health referral submitted\n- Drainage supplies dispensed\n- Emergency contact numbers provided\n- Vital signs: BP 124/72, HR 78, SpO2 95% on RA\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Successful ultrasound-guided placement of right indwelling pleural catheter for management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion with evidence of trapped lung. Patient counseled that spontaneous pleurodesis less likely given trapped lung physiology.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Drainage schedule: Every other day initially, QOD-TIW based on symptoms and output\n- Home health nursing to assist with first 3 drainage sessions\n- Weekly site assessment\n- Monitor output volumes (record in drainage log provided)\n- Signs/symptoms to report: fever, increasing purulent drainage, catheter malfunction, significant bleeding\n- Clinic follow-up in 2 weeks\n- Continue oncology treatment as scheduled\n- If persistent high-volume drainage without pleurodesis after 8-12 weeks, consider pleuroscopy with talc poudrage",

Patient remains ventilator-dependent with anticipated prolonged intubation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to percutaneous tracheostomy were discussed with the patient's wife (patient sedated). Surrogate indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was obtained.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prolonged mechanical ventilation; ARDS\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Tracheostomy, Planned (Percutaneous, Bronchoscopic Assistance) (CPT 31600)\nATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor\nASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Amanda White\nRT: Christopher Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)\nMONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.\nWith bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nA syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.\nThe inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.\nThe Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.\nFinally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.\nThe endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S): None\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Wilson underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance. Procedure performed without complications. CXR post-procedure shows appropriate positioning without pneumothorax. Continue mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Tracheostomy care per protocol.

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nConsent: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\nPostoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\n\nProcedure:\n\u2022 31624 Diagnostic bronchoscopy/lavage (BAL)\n\u2022 31628 Transbronchial biopsy single lobe\n\u2022 31629 TBNA single lobe\n\u2022 31627 Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted)\n\u2022 31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance\n\u2022 76377 3D rendering with interpretation and reporting of CT, US, Tomo modality (ION Planning Station)\n\u2022 77012 Radiology/radiologic guidance for CT guided needle placement (CIOS)\n\u2022 XU Unusual Non-Overlapping Service, the use of a service that is distinct because it does not overlap usual components of the main service\n\u2022 C7509 Diagnostic with cell washing(s) when performed, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7510 Bronchial alveolar lavage(s), with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7511 Single or multiple bronchial or endobronchial biopsy(ies), single or multiple sites, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\nAttending: Russell J. Miller, MD\nAnesthesia: General Anesthesia\nMonitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nInstrument:\n\u2022 Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\n\u2022 Ion Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nEstimated Blood Loss: Minimum\nComplications: None\n\nProcedure in Detail:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nThe therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\n\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\n\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.\n\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\n\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSpecimen(s):\n\u2022 TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology\n\nImpression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to PACU\n\u2022 Obtain chest X-ray\n\u2022 Discharge home once cleared by PACU\n\u2022 Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nRussell J.

Three thoracenteses with non-diagnostic cytology. Recent history of 20-pound weight loss and progressive dyspnea. PET-CT showing pleural thickening with moderate FDG uptake. Pleuroscopy for diagnosis.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Complete pre-procedure assessment\n- Informed consent with detailed risk discussion\n- Patient NPO since midnight\n- Timeout performed\n- CT chest reviewed: Large left effusion with enhancing pleura, no obvious mass\n- PET-CT: Diffuse pleural uptake, SUV max 5.4\n- Labs: WBC 8.9K, Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, Platelets 342K, PT/INR normal, Creatinine 1.0\n- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm\n- Vital signs: BP 142/86, HR 76, SpO2 92% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\n- Monitored anesthesia care\n- Propofol infusion with midazolam premedication\n- Fentanyl for analgesia\n- Spontaneous ventilation maintained\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Right lateral decubitus position\n- Left hemithorax uppermost\n- Appropriate padding and positioning\n- Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitoring, blood pressure monitoring\n\n*Access:*\n- Point-of-care ultrasound performed\n- Left lateral chest, 7th intercostal space, mid-axillary line selected\n- Chlorhexidine prep with sterile technique\n- Local anesthesia: 20 mL 1% lidocaine\n- 10 mm skin incision\n- Blunt dissection through intercostal space\n- Pleural space entered\n- Initial pleural fluid: 500 mL turbid yellow fluid drained\n- 10 mm trocar placed\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid pleuroscope (7 mm, 0-degree) inserted\n- Systematic survey of pleural cavity\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Diffuse pleural thickening with irregular, nodular surface. White-yellow plaques visible. Areas of pleural fibrosis.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Marked thickening (up to 1 cm estimated) with diffuse nodular changes. Cobblestone appearance in areas. No discrete masses but confluent involvement.\n- **Diaphragm:** Diaphragmatic pleura significantly thickened and irregular\n- **Lung:** Lung expansion limited due to visceral pleural involvement (trapped lung)\n- **Overall Impression:** Diffuse pleural thickening and nodularity highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- Multiple deep pleural biopsies from parietal pleura (10 specimens)\n- Biopsies included pleural tissue and underlying muscle\n- Rigid forceps used for adequate tissue samples\n- 3 biopsies from visceral pleura (limited by trapped lung)\n- Additional biopsy sent for special studies (electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry)\n- Hemostasis confirmed after each biopsy\n\n*Therapeutic Consideration:*\n- Due to trapped lung physiology, pleurodesis not performed\n- Would be ineffective given inability of lung to expand\n- Complete drainage: total 1,350 mL turbid fluid\n- 24 French chest tube placed under direct visualization\n- Tube positioned for optimal drainage\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient stable, transferred to recovery\n- Chest tube to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: chest tube in place, trapped lung confirmed with inability to expand to chest wall, no pneumothorax\n- Patient breathing comfortably\n- Vital signs: BP 136/82, HR 78, SpO2 95% on 2L NC\n- Pain controlled (3/10 with IV medications)\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (13 specimens) - histopathology\n- Tissue for immunohistochemistry (mesothelioma panel)\n- Tissue for electron microscopy\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, cell count, chemistry\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy with findings highly suspicious for malignant pleural mesothelioma. Trapped lung physiology identified. Adequate tissue obtained for comprehensive diagnosis including special studies.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DISPOSITION:** \nAdmitted for chest tube management and pathology results\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube to water seal, monitor drainage\n- Serial chest X-rays\n- Pathology expected in 5-7 days (including special studies)\n- Thoracic oncology consultation\n- Occupational medicine referral for asbestos exposure history\n- Given trapped lung, will likely require indwelling pleural catheter for long-term management\n- Remove chest tube when output minimal and patient comfortable\n- Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion once pathology confirmed\n- Discuss treatment options (chemotherapy, radiation, clinical trials) per oncology\n- Consider palliative care involvement\n- Follow up in clinic 1 week post-discharge",

PFTs show restrictive pattern with DLCO 45% predicted. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to whole lung lavage were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)\nATTENDING: Dr. Richard Brown\nASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Daniel Martinez\nRT: Sarah Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus\nThe patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.\nThe bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.\nLavage Procedure:\nThe patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37\u00b0C) 0.9% normal saline.\nSerial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:\n\nAliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment\nAliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment\nAliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid\nAliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid\nAliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid\nAliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear\n\nTotal volume instilled: 6000mL\nTotal volume returned: 5820mL\nNet balance: -180mL (absorbed)\nThe effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.\nAfter completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT position was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nLavage fluid (first aliquot) sent for cell count, cytology, and periodic acid-Schiff staining\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Rodriguez underwent successful whole lung lavage of the left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Procedure completed without complications. Patient will undergo right lung lavage in 4-6 weeks pending clinical response. Post-procedure CXR shows expected mild bilateral infiltrates, no pneumothorax. Plan for 6-minute walk test and PFTs in 4 weeks to assess response. GM-CSF therapy to be discussed with pulmonology.",

    "note_text": "Patient: Brian Foster\nMRN: 6927483\nDate of Procedure: December 7, 2016\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy\n\nSurgeon: Daniel Carter, MD\nAssistant: Monica Taylor, MD\nIndications: Left mainstem obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nOn initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.\n\nAt this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.\n\nSubsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Await tissue diagnosis\n\u2022 ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung\n\u2022 If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent\n\nDaniel Carter, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Two prior EBUS-TBNA attempts at outside hospital yielded non-diagnostic specimens. PET-CT shows intensely FDG-avid station 4R and station 7 nodes. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to EBUS with intranodal forceps biopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, etiology unknown\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: EBUS-Guided Intranodal Forceps Biopsy (CPT 31652, 31653)\nATTENDING: Dr. Lisa Murphy\nASSISTANT: Dr. John Mitchell, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Patricia Davis\nRT: James Wilson\n\nANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation with Midazolam 3mg IV and Fentanyl 150mcg IV\nMONITORING: Continuous pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus BF-UC180F EBUS bronchoscope, 21G EBUS needle, 1.1mm mini-forceps\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter sedation and timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nThe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the oral route. 5cc of 2% lidocaine was instilled for topical anesthesia. Initial airway inspection was unremarkable.\nStation 4R (Right paratracheal):\n\nSize: 24mm (short axis)\nEcho Features: Heterogeneous, irregular borders, comet-tail artifacts suggestive of calcification\nPET SUV: 8.5\n\nInitial TBNA with 21G needle was performed (3 passes). ROSE showed predominantly inflammatory cells with necrotic debris, non-diagnostic.\nIntranodal Forceps Biopsy Technique:\nThe EBUS 21G needle was used to create a tract through the bronchial wall and nodal capsule under real-time ultrasound guidance. The needle was removed and 1.1mm mini-forceps were advanced through the established tract into the lymph node under ultrasound visualization. The forceps jaws were opened and visible ultrasound artifact confirmed intra-nodal position. Four core samples were obtained with visible tissue in forceps each time.\nROSE on forceps specimens: Adequate cellularity with necrotizing granulomas and multinucleated giant cells, consistent with granulomatous inflammation.\nStation 7 (Subcarinal):\n\nSize: 18mm (short axis)\nEcho Features: Similar to 4R with heterogeneous pattern\nPET SUV: 7.2\n\nSimilar intranodal forceps biopsy technique performed with 3 core samples obtained. ROSE: Granulomatous inflammation.\nHemostasis was adequate after each sampling with no immediate complications. Final inspection showed no bleeding.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. The attending, Dr. Murphy, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nStation 4R: TBNA x3 (cytology), IFB x4 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)\nStation 7: IFB x3 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Anderson underwent successful EBUS with intranodal forceps biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes. Preliminary cytology shows necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Differential includes sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, fungal infection. Awaiting AFB and fungal cultures. Infectious disease consultation requested. Follow up in clinic in 1 week.",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: Michael Thompson\nMRN: 7294163\nDate of Procedure: March 1, 2021\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement\n\nSurgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD\nIndications: Airway obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.\n\nAirway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.\n\nTumor debulking was performed using APC to \"burn and shave\" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\n\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Post-procedure x-ray\n- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance\n- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\n\nJennifer Williams, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology\nNaval Medical Center San Diego\n\n________________________________________",

Ion robotic navigational bronchoscopy\n2. Radial EBUS\n3. Transbronchial biopsies\n4. Bronchoalveolar lavage\n\nINDICATION: 64M with remote history of colon cancer (stage II, 2010) now with multiple lung nodules. Largest nodule RLL posterior segment 2.6cm, PET SUV 5.1. Other nodules range 0.8-1.4cm bilaterally. Biopsy needed for diagnosis.\n\nCONSENT: Standard procedural risks discussed including but not limited to pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, chest tube placement. Questions answered. Written consent obtained.\n\nANESTHESIA DETAILS:\nPatient brought to OR, monitored anesthesia care established. General anesthesia induced with propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium. Intubation with 8.0 ETT placed at 22cm, confirmed with ETCO2 and auscultation.\n\nVentilation: Pressure control mode, Pinsp 18, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 55%, Pmean 13\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\n\nTime-out performed confirming patient identity, procedure, and site. All imaging reviewed.\n\nCT chest with contrast from 01/25/2025 imported to Intuitive Ion planning system. Three-dimensional airway reconstruction performed. Navigation plan created to RLL posterior segment nodule (largest/most FDG-avid lesion).\n\nIon bronchoscope inserted through ETT. Initial airway survey:\n- Vocal cords: not visualized (via ETT)\n- Trachea: patent, mild anterior bowing, no stenosis\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right mainstem: patent\n- Left mainstem: patent, no endobronchial lesions\n\nAutomatic registration initiated. Adequate landmark correlation achieved. Fiducial error: 1.5mm. Confidence sweep performed - stable alignment throughout planned trajectory.\n\nIon catheter advanced to RLL posterior segment under navigational guidance. Real-time position tracking showed tool-to-target distance of 0.6cm.\n\nRadial EBUS (20MHz probe) inserted through Ion extended working channel. Probe advanced to target showing concentric echogenic pattern with heterogeneous internal echo. Lesion measured 24mm in largest dimension.\n\nCone-beam CT acquired for trajectory verification. Fusion overlay (NaviLink) confirmed catheter tip within lesion borders, 4mm from center.\n\nSAMPLING PERFORMED:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies x 7 (formalin for histology)\n- Cytology brushings x 3 (ThinPrep)\n- BAL from RLL posterior segment: 100cc instilled, 45cc return (sent for cell count, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures, cytology)\n\nROSE: Preliminary cytology shows atypical cells, cannot exclude malignancy. Final pathology pending.\n\nHemostasis confirmed with direct visualization. No active bleeding. Airways suctioned clear.\n\nFINDINGS SUMMARY:\n- RLL posterior segment nodule successfully localized and sampled\n- No endobronchial lesions\n- No significant bleeding\n\nPatient tolerated procedure well. Extubated in OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition, oxygen saturation 98% on 2L NC.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10mL\n\nSPECIMENS: As listed above\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE PLAN:\n1. Routine post-bronchoscopy monitoring\n2. Chest X-ray in 2 hours to r/o pneumothorax\n3. Discharge home same day if CXR negative and stable\n4. Follow-up IP clinic 2 weeks for pathology results\n5. If additional nodules need sampling after final path review, will schedule staged procedure\n\nProcedure supervised and performed by Dr. Melissa Anderson, Attending Physician.",

CT imaging shows target left upper lobe with fissure integrity >95%. Chartis assessment confirms absence of collateral ventilation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to endobronchial valve therapy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe heterogeneous emphysema with target left upper lobe\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Endobronchial Valve Placement (CPT 31647, 31648)\nATTENDING: Dr. Catherine Lee\nASSISTANT: Dr. Brian Thompson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Michelle Rodriguez\nRT: Steven Clark\nAnesthesia: Dr. Jennifer Adams\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope, Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System, Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Pulmonx)\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.5 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived. Patient received Cefazolin 2g IV and Methylprednisolone 125mg IV prior to procedure.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT. Complete airway survey showed:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nRight lung: Patent airways, emphysematous changes\nLeft lung: Patent airways with severe emphysematous destruction especially in upper lobe segments\n\nChartis Assessment:\nBalloon occlusion of the left upper lobe was performed at the LUL orifice using the Chartis balloon catheter. The balloon was inflated with saline to achieve complete occlusion confirmed visually and by loss of airflow.\nChartis Results:\n\nTest duration: 6 minutes\nFlow: Declined to zero by minute 4\nResistance: Progressive increase\nConclusion: CV NEGATIVE (no collateral ventilation detected)\n\nBased on Chartis confirmation of absent collateral ventilation, proceeded with valve placement.\nValve Placement:\nThe following Zephyr Endobronchial Valves were deployed:\n\nLB1+2 (Apical-posterior segment): 4.0mm valve\nLB1+2c (Anterior segment): 4.0mm valve\nLB3 (Superior segment): 4.0mm valve\n\nAll valves were deployed under direct visualization using the Zephyr Loading System. Each valve expanded appropriately and demonstrated one-way valve function with visible flutter during expiration and occlusion during inspiration. Final bronchoscopic inspection confirmed:\n\nAll three valves in good position\nComplete LUL occlusion achieved\nNo airflow detected through valves\nNo immediate complications\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Lee, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S): None\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Harris underwent successful endobronchial valve placement in the left upper lobe for severe emphysema. Post-procedure management per protocol:\nPost-BLVR Protocol:\n\nAdmit to monitored bed\nPneumothorax kit at bedside\nContinuous pulse oximetry and telemetry\nCXR immediately post-procedure and at 4 hours\nDay 1: Bedrest, resume home COPD medications\nDay 2-4: Progressive mobilization with daily CXRs\nDischarge planning on Day 4 if stable\nFollow-up IP clinic in 2 weeks with repeat CXR and PFTs in 6 weeks\n\nPatient and family counseled on 30-35% pneumothorax risk and when to seek emergency care.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.\n\nOn the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).\n\nOn the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.\n\nFollowing inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Patient to PACU for recovery\n\u2022 Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return\n\nGregory Hamilton, MD",

A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction\u2014approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.\n\nThe video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.\n\nSubsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.\n\nThe tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.\n\nPersistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.\n\nFollowing verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.\n\nComplications: None\nEstimated Blood Loss: 30 cc\n\nPost-procedure Recommendations:\n- Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid\n- Await pathology results\n- Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise\n\n________________________________________",

CXR shows hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift. CT chest confirms suspected foreign body in right mainstem bronchus. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal were discussed with the patient's parents in detail. Parents indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration, right mainstem bronchus\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration (peanut fragment), right mainstem bronchus\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Foreign Body Removal\nATTENDING: Dr. Steven Martinez\nASSISTANT: Dr. Laura White, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Katherine Brown\nRT: Andrew Garcia\nAnesthesia: Dr. Michelle Chen\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended\nA 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.\nInitial Survey:\n\nLarynx: Normal\nVocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement\nTrachea: Normal caliber, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\n\nThe bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.\nForeign Body Retrieval:\nOptical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.\nThe foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.\nThe bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:\n\nRight mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material\nRight upper lobe: Patent\nRight middle lobe: Patent\nRight lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions\nLeft lung: Examined and found to be normal\n\nSecretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was identified. Final inspection showed:\n\nComplete foreign body removal\nMild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding\nPatent bilateral airways\n\nThe bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.\nThe attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nForeign body: Peanut fragment (retained for documentation)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Emma underwent successful rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal. A peanut fragment was removed from the right mainstem bronchus without complication. Post-procedure CXR ordered to confirm resolution of hyperinflation. Observe overnight with monitoring. Discharge tomorrow if stable. No bronchodilators needed. Counsel parents on choking prevention. Follow up with pediatrician in 1 week.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without any endoluminal obstruction. On the right, there was minimal structuring of the bronchus intermedius. On the left, the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially, and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded.\n\nRadial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation. However, due to the proximal obstruction, dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a guide wire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point, we performed APC to the left mainstem followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly recanalize the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly reopened, but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets. However, once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem, a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2 mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture.\n\nAt this point, to protect from major vascular bleeding, we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem, after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax. In the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation, we felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area, a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Patient to remain intubated tonight\n\u2022 CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung\n\u2022 Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery\n\u2022 Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight, place left side down, intubate right mainstem, call me (602-791-3135) and pediatric surgeon immediately\n\u2022 We will continue to follow\n\nKevin Martinez, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Exudative by Light's criteria. Two negative cytologies. CT findings suggestive of pleural disease but no definitive mass. Pleuroscopy for tissue diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Pre-procedure evaluation completed\n- Informed consent obtained, patient understands risks including bleeding, infection, need for chest tube, respiratory failure\n- Goals of care discussed\n- Timeout performed with all team members\n- CT chest: Moderate right pleural effusion with subtle pleural thickening\n- Prior thoracentesis results reviewed: exudative, negative cytology x2, pH 7.35\n- Labs: WBC 7.1K, Hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, Platelets 256K, INR 1.0, Creatinine 0.8\n- Vital signs: BP 134/78, HR 82, SpO2 94% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\n- Monitored anesthesia care\n- Propofol infusion (total 420 mg)\n- Fentanyl 100 mcg IV\n- Midazolam 2 mg IV for anxiolysis\n- Patient maintained adequate spontaneous respiration\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Left lateral decubitus position\n- Right side up\n- Appropriate positioning with pillows and padding\n- Standard ASA monitoring\n\n*Access:*\n- Ultrasound-guided site selection\n- Right lateral chest, 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line\n- Betadine followed by chlorhexidine skin prep\n- Local anesthesia: 18 mL 1% lidocaine\n- 10 mm incision with #15 blade\n- Blunt dissection using Kelly clamp technique\n- Pleural space identified\n- 700 mL clear yellow fluid initially evacuated\n- 10 mm trocar inserted without difficulty\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid pleuroscope (7 mm, 0-degree) introduced\n- Comprehensive pleural examination performed\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Scattered small white nodules (2-5 mm) over visceral surface, estimated 15-20 lesions total. Intervening normal appearing pleura.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Several larger nodular lesions (8-12 mm) on posterolateral parietal pleura. Approximately 6-8 distinct nodules identified. Areas of pleural inflammation surrounding nodules.\n- **Diaphragm:** 2-3 small nodules on diaphragmatic surface\n- **Lung:** Adequate lung expansion, no evidence of trapped lung\n- **Overall Impression:** Multifocal pleural nodules concerning for metastatic disease vs lymphoma\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- 6 targeted biopsies from parietal pleural nodules (largest lesions)\n- 4 biopsies from visceral pleural nodules\n- Adequate tissue obtained with optical forceps\n- Good hemostasis after each biopsy\n- Specimens appropriately labeled\n- Additional tissue sent for flow cytometry (concern for lymphoma)\n\n*Therapeutic Intervention:*\n- Given good lung expansion and possibility of malignancy, decision made to proceed with talc pleurodesis\n- Complete fluid drainage: total 1,250 mL\n- 5 grams sterile graded talc insufflated\n- Talc distributed evenly throughout pleural space under direct visualization\n- Attention paid to coating all surfaces\n- 28 French chest tube placed under direct vision\n- Chest tube appropriately positioned\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient transferred to PACU in stable condition\n- Chest tube connected to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure portable chest X-ray: chest tube well positioned, talc visible throughout right hemithorax, minimal residual effusion, no pneumothorax\n- Patient awake, alert, comfortable\n- Vital signs: BP 128/74, HR 78, SpO2 96% on 2L NC\n- Pain score 2/10 with IV medications\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (10 specimens) - histopathology\n- Fresh tissue - flow cytometry\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, flow cytometry, cell count\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy revealing multifocal pleural nodules suspicious for metastatic disease or lymphoma. Talc pleurodesis performed given adequate lung expansion. Comprehensive tissue sampling obtained for diagnosis including flow cytometry.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DISPOSITION:** \nAdmitted to general medical floor for post-procedure care\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube management: water seal after 24 hours if output appropriate\n- Monitor for post-pleurodesis fever (expected and benign)\n- Acetaminophen 1000 mg q6h scheduled\n- Ibuprofen 600 mg q8h PRN\n- Opioid pain management as needed\n- Daily chest X-rays\n- Remove chest tube when: output <150 mL/24h, no air leak, lung expanded\n- Anticipated chest tube duration: 2-4 days\n- Await pathology and flow cytometry (3-5 days)\n- Hematology/oncology consultation pending diagnosis\n- Follow up in clinic 2 weeks post-discharge with imaging\n- Repeat chest X-ray 6 weeks to assess pleurodesis efficacy",

Staging and tissue diagnosis needed.\n\n**PROCEDURES:**\n- EBUS-TBNA of mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes\n- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy\n- Radial EBUS\n- Transbronchial biopsy of LUL mass\n\n**CLINICAL CONTEXT:**\nPatient with 50 py smoking history, now with large LUL mass crossing fissure. PET shows: primary lesion SUV 11.3, station 5 (AP window) 2.4cm SUV 6.7, station 7 1.9cm SUV 5.2, station 10L 1.6cm SUV 4.8. Need staging before treatment planning.\n\n**MEDICATIONS/ANESTHESIA:**\nModerate-deep sedation. Propofol infusion (bolus 200mg, then 75-150 mcg/kg/min). Fentanyl 125mcg IV. Patient maintained spontaneous respirations with supplemental O2 via NC.\n\n**PART 1 - EBUS EXAMINATION:**\n\nEBUS scope (Olympus) inserted through mouth.\n\nLYMPH NODE SURVEY:\n\n*Station 2R:* 8mm - not sampled (too small)\n\n*Station 4R:* 11mm - appears reactive, not sampled\n\n*Station 4L:* 14mm - appears reactive, not sampled\n\n*Station 5 (AP window):*\n- Measured: 24mm x 18mm\n- Echo: Hypoechoic, heterogeneous\n- Shape: Oval with irregular borders\n- Blood flow: Present on Doppler\n- **Sampled: 22G needle x 5 passes**\n- ROSE: \"Positive for malignancy, NSCLC\"\n\n*Station 7 (subcarinal):*\n- Measured: 18mm x 15mm\n- Echo: Hypoechoic, fairly homogeneous\n- **Sampled: 22G needle x 4 passes**\n- ROSE: \"Positive for malignancy, similar to station 5\"\n\n*Station 10L (left hilar):*\n- Measured: 15mm x 12mm\n- Echo: Hypoechoic\n- **Sampled: 22G needle x 3 passes**\n- ROSE: \"Positive for malignancy\"\n\n*Station 11L:* Not well-visualized on EBUS\n\n**PART 2 - EMN BRONCHOSCOPY OF PRIMARY TUMOR:**\n\nEBUS scope removed. Standard therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) inserted.\n\nInitial airway survey:\n- Trachea: patent, no extrinsic compression\n- Carina: sharp\n- LUL orifice: partially narrowed by external compression from mass\n- LUL segments: able to pass scope, but narrowed\n- Remainder of left and right bronchial tree: patent\n\n**EMN Navigation:**\nSuperDimension system used. CT from 01/10/2025 uploaded.\n\nTarget: LUL mass (posterior segment component - anterior component has endobronchial extension)\n\nRegistration: Automatic + manual verification. 8 points confirmed. System accuracy indicator >90%.\n\nLocatable guide advanced to LUL posterior segment. Navigation suggested tool within 9mm of target center.\n\n**Radial EBUS:**\n- Pattern: Concentric initially, then lost signal (likely probe too close to chest wall/fissure)\n- Repositioned catheter 8mm proximally\n- New pattern: Eccentric but visualizing lesion\n- Lesion: Very heterogeneous, areas of necrosis likely present\n- Size by ultrasound: >35mm\n\n**Sampling via guide sheath:**\n- Forceps biopsies: 9 specimens (some friable, concerning for necrosis)\n- Brush cytology: 4 passes\n- Needle aspiration: 21G needle, 3 passes\n- BAL: 80cc in, 35cc returned\n\n**ROSE (Primary Tumor):**\n\"Adequate sample. Malignant cells present. Poorly differentiated carcinoma, likely squamous cell carcinoma based on cytologic features. Differs from adenocarcinoma pattern sometimes seen - recommend awaiting permanent sections for final classification.\"\n\n**ADDITIONAL SAMPLING - ENDOBRONCHIAL COMPONENT:**\n\nReturned to LUL orifice. Visible endobronchial tumor on anterior segment ostium.\n\nDirect endobronchial biopsies: 4 specimens using standard forceps.\n\nROSE: \"Squamous cell carcinoma confirmed\"\n\nMinimal bleeding from endobronchial biopsy site. Resolved with gentle suction.\n\n**COMPLETION:**\n\nTotal procedure time: 67 minutes\n\nPatient tolerated well. No complications. Extubated to room air. Stable.\n\n**EBL:** ~15mL\n\n**SPECIMENS:**\n1. Station 5 TBNA x5\n2. Station 7 TBNA x4\n3. Station 10L TBNA x3\n4. LUL mass TBBx x9 (via EMN)\n5. LUL mass brushings x4\n6. LUL mass needle aspirate x3\n7. LUL mass BAL\n8. LUL endobronchial tumor biopsies x4\n\n**ROSE SUMMARY:**\n- N2 disease present (stations 5, 7)\n- N1 disease present (station 10L)\n- Primary tumor: Squamous cell carcinoma\n\n**IMPRESSION:**\nStage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of LUL (T3-4 given size/fissure involvement, N2-3, M0). Not surgical candidate. Needs definitive chemoradiation vs clinical trial.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Brain MRI for staging\n- Tumor board discussion\n- Medical onc + radiation onc consults\n- F/u IP clinic 1 week\n\nCXR ordered post-procedure - prelim read shows no PTX.\n\nDr. Sarah Williams - attending, present throughout",

Esophageal stent migration through distal trachea and left mainstem\n2.         Left mainstem occlusion secondary to  esophageal stent\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n1.        Tracheoesophageal fistula status post tracheal Y-stent placement\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n1.        Rigid bronchoscopy with esophageal stent removal \n2.        Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement\n3.        Bronchoscopic intubation\nSURGEON: Jordan Parks MD\nINDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction secondary to esophageal stent migration\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   \nComplications:  Extension of TE fistula \nRecommendations:\n-        Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.\n-        Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU\n-        Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible \n-        Appreciate GI recommendations. \n-        Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware\n-        Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient\u2019s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-        If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-        Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).\n-        Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-        If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.        \nJordan Parks, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nUCLA Medical Center",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp. On the right there was mucosal changes/eryethema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared un-effected. The BI was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without There was mild structuring on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior and lateral and posterior basal segments partially obstructed from stricture (50%). On the left the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingual was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected. \nFollowing inspection we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3cm length with a 12,13.5,15 CRE balloon with post dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band like strictures within the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6,7,8 CRE balloon to the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily by passed into the segments. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  \nRecommendations:\n\u00b7\tPatient to PACU for recovery\n\u00b7\tPatient to follow-up with me PRN if symptoms return",

    "note_text": "DATE OF PROCEDURE: 8/1/2022\nPatient name: Calder, Ethan \nMRN: 20578149\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant central airway obstruction.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y- stent placement \nSURGEON: Russell Miller, MD\nINDICATIONS: Airway obstruction\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation) we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and has to convert to a 12mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.  Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.  It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression. Tumor debulking  was performed using APC to  \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved. \nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position. Post-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery. \n\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\t\n\nMaya Ellington MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nUniversity Medical Center Los Angeles",

A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction\u2014approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.\nThe video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.\nSubsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.\nThe tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.\nPersistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.\nFollowing verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.\nComplications: None\nEstimated Blood Loss: 30 cc\nPost-procedure Recommendations: \n-\tAdmit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid. \n-\tAwait pathology results. \n-\tUpon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise.",

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient\u2019s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\nPost procedure diagnosis:\n-\tStent infection\n-\tStent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.\n-\tPersistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent \n-\ts/p airway stent removal\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await cultures\n- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula\n- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.  \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the left lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 1600cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had diffuse carcinomatosis with multiple hard white pleural nodules covering the parietal and visceral pleura.  No adhesions were present Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 12 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, the pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly.\nComplications: None\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed mild post-procedural subcutaneous air with full lung re-expansion and IPC in place\nEstimated Blood Loss: 15cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion \nRecommendation:\nWill await pathology and microbiological studies\nPatient education on pleural catheter draining and will next week for initial drainage.\nJordan Parks, MD \nPulmonology Medicine\nUCLA Medical Center",

Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nSevere extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent. \nRecommendations:\n\u00b7\tTransfer to ICU\n\u00b7\tObtain post procedure CXR\n\u00b7\tTID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent",

Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation\nSURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD\nASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD\nINDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n\u2022\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n\u2022\tAwait final pathology results  \n\u2022\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy. \n \nI Aria Winslow was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure. \n \nAria Winslow MD \nInterventional Pulmonary",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\n\nATTENDING:  \nSofia Mitchell MD\n\nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nIon Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\tNone\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.\nRobotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1\u202fmm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. \nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n\nSPECIMEN(S): \nTBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.\nBAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nTransfer to PACU\nObtain chest X-ray\nDischarge home once cleared by PACU\nAwait path and culture results and based on findings f/u for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nSofia Mitchell, MD\n2/15/2024",

Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\nPatient brought to IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.\n\nModerate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:\n- Normal larynx and trachea\n- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity\n- Active \"sucking\" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak\n\nINTERVENTION:\nAttempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.\n\nCOMPLICATION:\nImmediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.\n\nMANAGEMENT:\n- Procedure aborted\n- 100% O2 applied\n- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift\n- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted\n- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement\n- Patient stabilized\n\nADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:\nAfter stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.\n- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident\n- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated\n\nFINAL ASSESSMENT:\n- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate\n- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube\n- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE PLAN:\n- ICU admission  \n- Serial CXRs\n- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours\n- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed\n\nPriya Patel, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology\nStanford Medical Center\n\nAttending Note: Complex case with expected high-risk given bullous disease.

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina\u2019s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nAwait tissue diagnosis\nASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.\nIf patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. \nIf obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",

Alpha-1 patients often have basilar predominant disease (unlike smoking-related emphysema)\n2. Valve selection sizing based on CT measurements  \n3. Chartis interpretation and decision-making\n4. Complete vs. incomplete fissure implications\n\nPRE-PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:\n\u2611 Consent obtained and witnessed\n\u2611 Sedation plan reviewed with anesthesia\n\u2611 CT images loaded on workstation\n\u2611 Valves available (multiple sizes)\n\u2611 Chartis system prepared and tested\n\u2611 Fluoroscopy operational\n\u2611 Emergency equipment checked\n\nPROCEDURE WALKTHROUGH:\n\nSTEP 1: Airway Assessment\nFellow performed systematic examination with attending supervision. Appropriate technique demonstrated for complete inspection.\n\nSTEP 2: Chartis Assessment  \nTarget: Left Lower Lobe\n- Catheter advanced to LLL\n- Balloon inflated to create seal at LLL orifice\n- Baseline flow and resistance measured\n- Results: Flow decay to <30mL/min = NEGATIVE CV\nTeaching point: This indicates absent collateral ventilation and favorable for valve therapy\n\nSTEP 3: Bronchial Measurement & Valve Selection\nCT-based measurements reviewed:\n- LB6: 6.8mm diameter \u2192 5.5mm valve selected\n- LB8-10: 5.2mm diameter \u2192 4.0mm valve selected\n\nSTEP 4: Valve Deployment (Fellow performed with guidance)\n- First valve (LB6): Required repositioning due to initial incomplete seal. Good learning opportunity regarding deployment technique.\n- Second valve (LB8-10): Successful first attempt with excellent technique\n- Final bronchoscopy: Both valves well-positioned, complete occlusion confirmed\n\nTEACHING POINTS POST-PROCEDURE:\n1. Valve repositioning is common and not a complication\n2. Visual confirmation of complete lobar occlusion is essential\n3. Post-procedure care including steroid/antibiotic prophylaxis rationale\n4. Expected timeline for symptom improvement (4-6 weeks typically)\n\nFELLOW ASSESSMENT:\nDemonstrated good procedural skills. Area for improvement: Pre-deployment assessment of valve orientation. Overall: Progressing well in BLVR competency.\n\nPATIENT OUTCOME: Tolerated well, stable, admitted for observation per protocol.\n\nMarcus Williams, MD, FCCP\nProgram Director, Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellowship\nTemple University Hospital\nPhiladelphia, PA",

Informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol.\nTime-Out:\nA formal time-out was performed confirming the patient\u2019s identity, procedure, and site.\n________________________________________\nI. Initial Airway Inspection\nFindings:\n\u2022\tThe flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the 8.5 ETT and advanced into the trachea.\n\u2022\tThe trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina.\n\u2022\tThe bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level.\n\u2022\tInspection notable for an endobronchial fungating mass in the RUL obstructing the superior and anterior segments.\n\u2022\tThe remaining airways appeared normal with no additional endobronchial abnormalities, mucosal irregularities, or abnormal secretions.\n________________________________________\nII. Tissue Sampling Procedures\nA. Right Upper Lobe (RUL) Endobronchial Biopsy\n\u2022\tAn endobronchial mass was identified obstructing the superior and anterior segments of the RUL.\n\u2022\tSampling Techniques:\no\tTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex transbronchial needle with five (5) passes.\no\tEndobronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with six (6) samples obtained.\no\tHemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine.\nB. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Lesion Biopsy\n\u2022\tA second lesion was identified in the superior segment of the LLL using radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with a concentric view.\n\u2022\tSampling Techniques:\no\tTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA): Performed using Periview Flex with four (4) passes.\no\tTransbronchial Forceps Biopsy: Performed with five (5) samples obtained.\no\tHemostasis: Moderate bleeding noted, successfully controlled with instillation of 2 cc of topical epinephrine.\nC. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) - Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Superior Segment\n\u2022\tA BAL was performed in the superior segment of the left lower lobe.\n\u2022\tInstillation: 110 cc normal saline\n\u2022\tReturn: 20 cc\n\u2022\tSamples sent for cytology, microbiology (bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures), and differential cell count.\nD. Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE)\n\u2022\tRight Upper Lobe (RUL) lesion: ROSE interpretation was malignant.\n\u2022\tLeft Lower Lobe (LLL) lesion: ROSE revealed abundant necrosis but pathology was unable to definitively confirm malignancy.\n________________________________________\nIII. Final Airway Re-Inspection and Conclusion\nFindings:\n\u2022\tNo active bleeding was noted on final airway inspection.\n\u2022\tNo evidence of airway compromise.\nEstimated Blood Loss: Moderate, successfully controlled with topical epinephrine.\nComplications: No immediate complications.\nDisposition/Plan:\n\u2022\tThe patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.\n\u2022\tPost-procedure CXR was performed to rule out pneumothorax or other complications.\n\u2022\tPathology, cytology, and microbiology results are pending.\n\u2022\tFollow-up bronchoscopy and multidisciplinary evaluation will be planned based on final pathology results.\nAttending: \nNolan Shepherd, DO\nInterventional Pulmonary and Critical Care\nTulsa Medical Center",

His emphysema is predominantly in the left upper lobe with CT demonstrating 85% destruction and essentially complete fissural integrity at 98%. \n\nAfter discussing risks and benefits, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. Monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and cardiac telemetry. Moderate sedation was achieved with appropriate medications.\n\nUsing a flexible bronchoscope, I entered through the mouth and performed a systematic evaluation of the entire tracheobronchial tree. The vocal cords were normal. The trachea and carina appeared unremarkable. Both mainstem bronchi were patent. Moving to the left upper lobe, I noted the characteristic changes of severe emphysema.\n\nI proceeded with Chartis assessment of the LUL which demonstrated absent collateral ventilation - an ideal finding for valve placement. Subsequently, I placed four Zephyr endobronchial valves: one 5.5mm valve in the lingular segments, and three 4.0mm valves in the upper division bronchi. Each valve was carefully sized and positioned to ensure complete occlusion without migration risk.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure remarkably well without complications. Post-procedure imaging confirmed appropriate valve positioning and early signs of target lobe volume reduction.\n\nSarah Kim, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology\nCleveland Clinic Foundation",

However, repeat CT at 6 weeks showed migration of RB2 valve with incomplete occlusion. Patient noted return of dyspnea over past 2 weeks.\n\nIMAGING REVIEW:\nComparison CT demonstrates:\n- RB1 valve: Excellent position, maintained\n- RB2 valve: Migrated distally approximately 1.5cm  \n- RB3 valve: Excellent position, maintained\n- Result: Incomplete RUL occlusion with air flow to anterior segment\n\nPROCEDURE PLAN: Bronchoscopic valve repositioning/replacement\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation. Original anatomy reviewed. \n\nFINDINGS:\n- RB1 and RB3 valves well-seated as expected\n- RB2 valve visible but clearly malpositioned in subsegmental bronchus\n- Surrounding granulation tissue present\n\nINTERVENTION:\nUsing specialized removal forceps, the migrated RB2 valve was carefully grasped at the retention hooks. Gentle rotational torque applied while maintaining steady traction. Valve successfully removed intact without mucosal injury.\n\nBronchus re-inspected: Mild granulation tissue at original deployment site. Conservative debridement performed with cytology brush.\n\nNEW VALVE PLACEMENT:\nAfter measuring, new 5.5mm Zephyr valve (one size larger than original 4.0mm) deployed in RB2 with improved wall contact and resistance to migration. Valve delivery system technique modified to ensure more proximal placement.\n\nCONFIRMATION:\nFinal bronchoscopy confirmed all three valves in excellent position with complete RUL occlusion. No air flow detected.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Successful removal of migrated EBV\n2. Successful replacement with larger valve\n3. Complete RUL occlusion restored\n4. No complications\n\nPLAN:\n- Outpatient procedure, observe 4 hours then discharge\n- Continue prophylactic antibiotics x 5 days  \n- Repeat CT in 6 weeks\n- Close follow-up given history of migration\n\nCatherine Sullivan, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology\nMayo Clinic Rochester\n\nNote: Migration risk factors for this patient included undersizing of original valve and thin bronchial walls. Consider starting with larger sizes in similar patients. - CS",

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nThe patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position, and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by ultrasound in the left 8th rib space. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nAn 18-gauge, 5 cm long echogenic percutaneous entry needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space, and fluid was aspirated to verify placement. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the needle, and the needle was then withdrawn. A 1.5 cm incision was made through the skin, and a 14 Fr dilator was advanced into the pleural space over the wire.\nThe dilator was removed, and gentle dissection with Kelly forceps was performed alongside the wire until the pleural space was entered. A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 8th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid, resulting in the removal of approximately 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe pleura had diffuse carcinomatosis, and thick adhesions were present with tethering of the lung to the chest wall. The 5 mm port was removed, and an 8 mm port was inserted in the same fashion through the original entry point. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture, with approximately five total biopsies taken. There was mild bleeding associated with the biopsies. An additional 375 cc of sanguineous fluid was then removed with suction applied through the port. Repeat examination of the pleural space showed residual bleeding had subsided.\nThe pleuroscopy telescope was then removed. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the port, and the port was withdrawn. A 14 Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain and pigtail straightening obturator were inserted into the pleural space over the wire. The obturator and wire were removed, and the drain was then immediately connected to a Pleur-Evac via the connecting tubing adapter. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and tidaling. The incision was then sutured into place with subcuticular 0 silk suture. Once the air leak had subsided, a chest X-ray was performed, which showed lung re-expansion. The chest tube was then removed, and the site was dressed with Steri-Strips, gauze, and Tegaderm.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed lung re-expansion and minimal residual effusion.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 20 cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion\nSpecimens:\n\u2022        Pleural fluid- 1275 cc (sent for cytology and microbiological analysis)\n\u2022        Pleural biopsies- 5 (sent for pathology and culture)\nRecommendation:\n\u2022        Await pathology and microbiological studies.\n\u2022        Suture removal in 2 weeks.\n\nTimothy Lundred, MD\nPulmonology Medicine\nColorado Medical Center",

    "note_text": "Patient: Hughes, Tena MRN: 308212892\nDATE OF PROCEDURE: 5/18/2022\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer with extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n1.\tResolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent \nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem\nSURGEON: Racheal Chung , MD \nASSISTANT: Jenny Smith MD (fellow)\nINDICATIONS: extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. The left vocal cord was noted to be fixed consistent with vocal cord paralysis. Muscle relaxants were then given and we then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Airway inspection was performed and there were thick purulent secretions throughout the airways which were suctioned. In the mid to distal trachea there was approximately 30-40% obstruction from posterior extrinsic compression. The right mainstem was approximately 15% obstructed at the proximal orifice and opened up to be widely patent distally.  The right-sided airways were free of endobronchial disease in the mucosa was normal.  On the left there was significant airway obstruction beginning at the orifice of the left mainstem with friable erythematous mucosa causing approximately 40% obstruction however in the mid left mainstem there is significant protrusion of extrinsic mass with likely some degree of submucosal infiltration resulting in about 90-95% airway obstruction.  The therapeutic bronchoscope could not pass the lesion.  We then attempted to pass lesion with the diagnostic Q 190 bronchoscope and were also unsuccessful. We then again attempted to pass lesion with the ultrasound P190 bronchoscope which was successfully able to bypass lesion.  Approximately 5 mm proximal to the LC2 carina the airways open to near normal luminal diameter.  There were thick postobstructive secretions at all left-sided airways which were suctioned. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed along with the LMA and a 10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. There is a significant week which impaired ability to ventilate and multiple attempts at packing the mouth were unsuccessful.  The 10 mm rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13 mm non-ventilating tracheoscope was introduced in the airway in a similar fashion with the hope that this would eliminate/reduce the ventilator leak however similar issues arose and we subsequently decided to remove the rigid bronchoscope and perform the procedure through a 8.5 ET tube which was placed by anesthesia.  There was some hypoxia for a few minutes mostly in the mid 80s but for a short period time in the upper 70s which was likely related to the recruitment from the time period of inadequate ventilation which eventually resolved allowing us to continue with the procedure. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed however slightly too distally and was retracted into proper position with forceps. Balloon dilatation was then performed of the stent which only partially open due to significant external compression using a 10/11/12 CRE balloon which expanded the stent with only mild deformity with a subsequent diameter of the left mainstem approximately 80% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer back to ward\n-\tPost-procedure x-ray\n-\tStart 3% saline nebs 3cc combined with 2cc albuterol 3 times daily for stent maintenance. \n-\tEnsure supplemental oxygen is humidified \n-\tPlease arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge. \nRacheal Chung MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Resolving Mediastinal Mass  status post tracheal Y-stent removal\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n1.        Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with  Tracheal stent removal\nINDICATIONS: Resolved tracheal compression\nSURGEON: Mark Parsons, DO\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and thick mucus and bloody secretions were suctioned from the stent. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The trachea mucosa was friable and inflamed but without residual obstruction. The right mainstem and distal airways were normal. The left mainstem was normal however a small fractures piece of the stent was found within the left mainstem which was removed with flexible forceps without difficulty. The left sided airways were re-inspected and normal without any other residual fractured stent pieces. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. Post-procedure, the patient developed laryngospasm requiring intubation by anesthesia. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted into the posterior oropharynx and 6cc of topical 1% lidocaine was injected onto the vocal cords prior to extubation after which the patient was able to adequately ventilate prior to transfer to the PACU. \nComplications: Post-procedure laryngospasm requiring re-intubation. \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer PACU\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- Discharge to home once criteria met. \n\n\nMark Parsons, DO\nOntario Healthcare",

Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule\n\nCLINICAL SCENARIO:\nPatient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. \n\nGeneral anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. \n\nOlympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:\n- Normal supraglottic structures\n- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy\n- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.\n\nRegistration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). \n\nSteerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.\n\nFluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).\n\nCryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:\n\nCycle 1: \n- Freeze time: 6 minutes\n- Temperature at probe tip: -165\u00b0C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20\u00b0C)\n\nCycle 2:\n- Freeze time: 6 minutes  \n- Temperature: -167\u00b0C\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes\n\nCycle 3:\n- Freeze time: 5 minutes\n- Temperature: -163\u00b0C\n- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)\n\nThroughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.\n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.\n\nCryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:\n- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)\n- No hemorrhage\n- No airway perforation\n- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)\n\nComplete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. \n\nBronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target\n2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)\n3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS\n4. No procedural complications\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nDRAINS/TUBES: None placed\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring\n2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry\n3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications\n4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging\n5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain\n6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)\n7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen\n8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake\n9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated\n10. Diet as tolerated\n11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course\n- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)\n- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation\n- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually\n\nDISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:\nExtensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.\n\nTotal procedure time: 94 minutes\nFluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  \nRadiation dose: 287 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\nATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.\n\n___________________________________________\nKevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nAssociate Professor of Medicine\nDirector of Advanced Bronchoscopy Fellowship\nDivision of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine\nStanford University School of Medicine\n\nCo-signed by:\nLisa Nguyen, MD (Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellow, PGY-6)\n\nProcedure dictated: 10/15/2025 16:45\nTranscribed: 10/15/2025 17:20\nElectronically authenticated: 10/15/2025 18:05",

Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nMODIFIED INDICATION: \nGiven active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.\n\n**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**\n\nPatient still with chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.\n\nPROCEDURE (Performed 11/08/2025, 0800hrs):\nGeneral anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.\n\nRFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:\n- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis\n- Then standard ablation (90\u00b0C x 8min) for tumor treatment\n- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment\n\nOUTCOME: \nSuccessfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None additional\n\nMODIFIED PLAN:\n- ICU monitoring continues\n- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr\n- CT chest at 48hr  \n- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved\n\n**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**\nThis represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure. Case to be presented at morbidity/mortality conference for systems review of management pathway.\n\nDr. Anthony Russo, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology - Tampa General\nAttending on call for emergent procedures\n\nCase reviewed with: Dr. Sarah Kim (Thoracic Surgery), Dr. James Liu (Interventional Radiology), Dr. Patricia Mendez (Pulmonary Critical Care)",

Patient deemed high surgical risk due to severe COPD (FEV1 38% predicted) and coronary artery disease with prior CABG.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nBronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right upper lobe peripheral nodule\n\nINDICATION:\n67-year-old gentleman with 45 pack-year smoking history presents with incidentally discovered 2.3 cm spiculated nodule in right upper lobe posterior segment. PET-CT demonstrates SUV max 8.4. Transthoracic needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Patient evaluated by thoracic surgery but deemed prohibitive surgical risk. Multidisciplinary tumor board recommended bronchoscopic ablation vs SBRT. Patient elected for bronchoscopic microwave ablation after extensive discussion of risks and benefits.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nAfter informed consent, patient brought to interventional pulmonology suite. Time-out performed. General anesthesia induced with propofol and rocuronium, patient intubated with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope advanced through ETT after securing airway. Initial survey bronchoscopy revealed patent airways without endobronchial lesions. \n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy performed using superDimension system with prior thin-slice CT protocol. Planning software identified target nodule in RUL posterior segment (RB1). Navigation successful with 8 steerable guide sheath advanced to peripheral location. Radial EBUS performed demonstrating target lesion in contact position with characteristic hypoechoic appearance. Target confirmed with cone-beam CT showing guide sheath within 5mm of lesion center.\n\nExtended working channel passed through guide sheath. Microwave ablation probe (Emprint 2.0, 15mm active tip) advanced through EWC to target site. Ablation parameters: 65 watts, 5 minute duration. Temperature monitoring showed gradual rise to 85\u00b0C at probe tip. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation. Post-ablation radial EBUS demonstrated hyperechoic changes consistent with coagulative necrosis. \n\nGuide sheath slowly withdrawn under direct visualization. Inspection revealed mild mucosal edema but no active bleeding. Airways suctioned clear. Patient emerged from anesthesia without complications. Extubated in suite and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal\nFLUIDS: 800 mL crystalloid\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nSPECIMENS: None sent\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RUL posterior segment target\n2. Microwave ablation completed per protocol with good real-time monitoring\n3. Post-ablation imaging confirms appropriate zone of coagulation\n\nPLAN:\n1. Admit for overnight observation\n2. Chest CT with contrast in 6 hours to assess for complications\n3. Pain control with scheduled acetaminophen and PRN oxycodone\n4. Incentive spirometry q2h while awake\n5. Follow-up CT chest in 6 weeks to assess treatment response\n6. Close PET-CT surveillance at 3, 6, and 12 months\n\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to 7 West pulmonary intermediate care\n\n_________________________________\nSarah Chen, MD, FCCP\nDirector, Interventional Pulmonology",

Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:\nThis is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.\n\nDETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.\n\nAnesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.\n\nOlympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from 09/20/2025 loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) identified and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.\n\nNavigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.\n\nCone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.\n\nExtended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90\u00b0C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.\n\nAfter completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90\u00b0C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.\n\nGuide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.\n\nAirways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution\nSPECIMENS SENT: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion\n2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones\n3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves\n4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage\n5. No immediate procedural complications identified\n\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven RLL peripheral adenocarcinoma, poor surgical candidate, status post successful bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Procedure technically successful with good positioning and ablation parameters. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary Intermediate Care Unit (7 East) for overnight observation\n2. Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry monitoring overnight\n3. Chest radiograph in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute complications\n4. CT chest with intravenous contrast in 24 hours to assess ablation zone and rule out complications\n5. Pain management: scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg q8h, oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN moderate pain, hydromorphone 0.5mg IV q4h PRN severe pain\n6. Aggressive pulmonary toilet: incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake, chest physiotherapy as needed\n7. Empiric antibiotics NOT indicated at this time given low infection risk\n8. Anticipated discharge tomorrow if overnight course uncomplicated and CT scan reassuring\n9. Follow-up arrangements: Clinic visit in 1 week with CXR, CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment, PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response\n10. Continue home medications including COPD regimen, cardiac medications\n11. Patient and family extensively counseled on post-procedure expectations, warning signs for complications (increasing dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis), importance of follow-up\n\nI have personally performed and supervised this entire procedure. All findings, interventions, and recommendations above represent my direct involvement and assessment.\n\nProcedure time: 87 minutes (includes anesthesia induction and emergence)\nFluoroscopy time: 3.2 minutes\nRadiation dose: 245 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\n_______________________________________\nElizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP\nProfessor of Medicine\nDirector, Interventional Pulmonology\nUniversity of Washington Medical Center\n\nElectronically signed: 09/28/2025 14:37 PST",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient\u2019s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty and was fully intact.  Once his stent was removed the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection. There was significant (near complete dynamic airway collapse of the trachea and mainstem bronchi as expected given known TBM.  The 1.9mm flexible cryoprobe was inserted through the working channel and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue with 30 second freeze thaw times and at least 3 activations per site. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nComplications: None\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to PACU and then to wards\n-  Plan for stent holiday to allow healing of granulation tissue and based on symptoms possible replacement of the stent sometime in the future.  \nJessica Muller MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nHouston Hospital",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: Susan M. O'Brien\nMRN: HUP-2025-7734  \nDOB: July 4, 1961 (64 years old)\nDATE: November 2, 2025\nLOCATION: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA\nPROCEDURALIST: Dr. Michael Steinberg, MD, FCCP\nASSISTANT: Dr. Rachel Kim, DO (IP Fellow)\n\nINDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:\nMs. O'Brien is a delightful 64-year-old former librarian who presents with right middle lobe peripheral nodule discovered on CT performed for evaluation of persistent cough. Initial imaging demonstrated 2.4 cm spiculated nodule in right middle lobe lateral segment with pleural retraction. PET scan showed intense uptake with SUV max 13.4. Navigational bronchoscopy with radial EBUS-guided biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. \n\nPatient has complicated medical history including chronic kidney disease stage 4 (not on dialysis, baseline creatinine 2.9), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), and severe osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures. Thoracic surgery evaluation determined patient to be extremely high risk for lobectomy with estimated perioperative mortality exceeding 15%. Radiation oncology consulted but patient declined stereotactic body radiation therapy after extensive discussion, preferring bronchoscopic intervention.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nI met with Ms. O'Brien and her husband in the pre-procedure area. We reviewed the nature of the procedure, expected benefits, and potential risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, need for chest tube placement, bronchopleural fistula, and possible need for surgical intervention for complications. We also discussed the possibility that ablation may not completely treat the tumor and that additional therapies might be necessary. Patient and family demonstrated excellent understanding and provided informed consent.\n\nPatient brought to bronchoscopy suite at 0815. Anesthesiology team (Dr. Paul Reynolds attending) present. Standard monitoring established. Given comorbidities and anticipated procedure duration, decision made for general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.\n\nFollowing induction and intubation with 8.0 ETT, therapeutic bronchoscope advanced revealing normal appearing airway anatomy throughout. No endobronchial lesions, external compressions, or dynamic collapse noted.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation initiated using Medtronic superDimension system with prior CT imaging from 10/20/2025. Planning performed identifying target in RML lateral segment. Registration achieved with 8 reference points yielding registration accuracy of 3.1mm.\n\nGuide sheath (8.0 Fr) navigated to peripheral target location. Due to RML anatomy with somewhat straight trajectory, navigation was relatively straightforward requiring approximately 8 minutes. Radial EBUS performed confirming target lesion in solid contact position. Lesion appeared as heterogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring approximately 24 x 21mm.\n\nCone-beam CT performed confirming guide sheath position within acceptable range of target (7mm from center). Pleural surface distance measured at 18mm - appropriate safety margin for microwave ablation.\n\nMicrowave ablation antenna (Medtronic Emprint system, 15mm active tip) advanced through extended working channel to target center. Pre-ablation checklist completed including: airway clearance verified, antenna position confirmed, impedance check normal (85 ohms), safety zone confirmed without major vessels in immediate ablation field.\n\nMicrowave ablation commenced with following parameters:\n- Power: 65 watts\n- Duration: 6 minutes\n- Mode: standard tissue\n- Temperature monitoring: peak temperature 92\u00b0C at antenna tip\n\nDuring ablation, patient remained remarkably stable with no hemodynamic changes. No arrhythmias noted. Respiratory mechanics unchanged. \n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic region replacing previously hypoechoic tumor, consistent with coagulation necrosis. Ablation zone appeared to extend adequately beyond visible tumor margins.\n\nEquipment removed sequentially with careful airway inspection showing:\n- Mild erythema at peripheral catheter contact sites\n- No ulceration or mucosal disruption  \n- No hemorrhage\n- Small amount of serous fluid (<5mL)\n\nRemainder of bronchoscopy unremarkable. Patient emerged from anesthesia smoothly. Extubated after meeting standard criteria. Transferred to recovery area with oxygen saturation 93% on room air (baseline similar per chart review).\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<5mL)\nFLUIDS: 750mL crystalloid  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None during procedure\nSPECIMENS: None sent\nDEVICES: Medtronic superDimension navigation, Emprint microwave system\n\nIMPRESSION:\nTechnically successful bronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right middle lobe peripheral adenocarcinoma in 64-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities precluding surgical resection.\n\nPLAN GOING FORWARD:\nPatient admitted to pulmonary step-down unit for monitoring. Initial portable chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax. CT chest with contrast performed this evening showed appropriate ablation zone without immediate complications. Patient doing well with minimal pain (3/10) controlled with oral acetaminophen. Planning discharge tomorrow with:\n\n- Close outpatient follow-up in 1 week with repeat chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6-8 weeks for initial response assessment (expecting to see decrease in size of ablation zone with central low attenuation)  \n- PET-CT in 3 months to assess metabolic response (successful ablation should show minimal or no FDG uptake)\n- Long-term surveillance CT every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months\n\nPatient counseled extensively on post-ablation syndrome (fever, flu-like symptoms possible for 3-5 days - normal inflammatory response). Instructed on warning signs for complications. Patient and husband expressed gratitude and understanding of plan.\n\nTime spent in procedure: 78 minutes\nTime spent in pre/post procedure counseling: 35 minutes\n\nDictated and electronically signed: Michael Steinberg, MD\nDate: 11/02/2025 at 1847 hours",

The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air. The electromagnetic navigation system was utilized with successful registration to the preoperative CT scan. The guide sheath was advanced to the left upper lobe apical-posterior segment and the radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmed tool-in-lesion position with a concentric echogenic pattern consistent with solid tissue. Total fluoroscopy time was five point one minutes with a dose area product of one hundred ninety-two centigray centimeters squared. Sampling included three needle aspirations using a twenty-one gauge needle, four transbronchial forceps biopsies, and two brush cytology specimens. There was minimal bleeding after the forceps biopsies which resolved spontaneously with gentle suction. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax or significant change from baseline. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home after two hours of observation in stable condition.",

The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air. The electromagnetic navigation system was utilized with successful registration to the preoperative CT scan. The guide sheath was advanced to the left upper lobe apical-posterior segment and the radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmed tool-in-lesion position with a concentric echogenic pattern consistent with solid tissue. Total fluoroscopy time was five point one minutes with a dose area product of one hundred ninety-two centigray centimeters squared. Sampling included three needle aspirations using a twenty-one gauge needle, four transbronchial forceps biopsies, and two brush cytology specimens. There was minimal bleeding after the forceps biopsies which resolved spontaneously with gentle suction. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax or significant change from baseline. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home after two hours of observation in stable condition.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle bronchi had stent in place with minimal mucous but granulation tissue the distal edge causing 50% obstruction. The right lower lobe bronchi stent was partially obstructed with thick yellow mucous. Using saline flushes and suction we were able to remove mucous. The right middle lobe stent was then grasped with flexible forceps by the proximal string and retracted. The stent was easily removed. There was significant inflammation and malacia at site of previous stent. The bronchoscope was advanced beyond the stenotic segment and the medial and lateral segments were visualized and intact.  The Right lower lobe stent was then removed in a similar fashion to the RML stent without difficulty. In the previous bed there was extensive inflammation and granulation tissue causing >50% obstruction of the airway. The bronchoscope was pushed through the obstruction using saline flushes and the distal basilar segments were visualized and intact. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were debulked with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps. During this process the superior segment of the RLL was visualized with sub-segments intact. There remained significant obstruction and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue using repetitive 30 second freeze thaw cycles. This was performed in a similar manner in the RML. Finally, using an 8-9-10 CRE dilatational balloon we were able to gently dilate the effected bronchi to increased luminal diameter. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful removal of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with significant residual granulation tissue.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- D/C when criteria met\n- Ok to return to Hawaii on Monday if asymptomatic over weekend. \n- Recommend repeat flexible bronchoscopy with pulmonologist at Tripler within the next week to remove debris following cryotherapy. \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight\n- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.\n- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray \n- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea and right sided airways were normal. The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.  At the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.  Distal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.  Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.  All of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.  At this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.  The first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.  The second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.  Finally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.  At this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.  Using flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.  Subsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.  At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.  Then, using a 8\u20139\u201310 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.  Cryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.  Finally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue. \nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-        Transfer patient back to the ICU\n-        Post-procedure x-ray\n-        Patient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis.  \nJordan Parks MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nGeneral anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.\n\nABLATION PARAMETERS:\n- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds\n- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  \n- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz\n- Number of treatment cycles: 3\n- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds\n- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)\n- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:\nAdvanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).\n\nOUTCOMES: \nSuccessfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.\n\nNOVEL FINDINGS: \nPFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.\n\nDISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis. Patient enrolled in long-term registry (5-year follow-up).\n\nResearch coordinator contacted. Data forms completed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nStudy PI: Richard Patel, MD\nProtocol: PULSE-LUNG-002",

    "note_text": "CASE PRESENTATION: Complex Navigation Bronchoscopy\n\nPATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS:\nA 64-year-old male (Case ID: C-847, Synthetic Name: Martin Lee, MRN: QQ-8473-R, DOB: 05/22/1960) former smoker with 45 pack-year history presented with an incidentally discovered left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule.\n\nIMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:\nComputed tomography demonstrated a 17mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe superior segment without clear bronchus sign. Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL APPROACH:\nGiven the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.\n\nSedation Protocol:\nDeep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.\n\nTechnical Details:\nThe electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension\u2122) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.\n\nThe extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.\n\nRadiation Exposure:\nTotal fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes\nDose-area product: 268 cGy\u00b7cm\u00b2\n(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)\n\nSampling Protocol:\nFollowing tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:\n- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens\n- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nSmall apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.\n\nQUALITY METRICS:\n- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved\n- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)\n- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete\n- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology\n\nDISCUSSION:\nThis case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",

Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.\nANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract\nEntry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space\nLocation: Mid-axillary line\nProcedure Steps:\n\nA finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.\nSterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).\n\nExit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line\nInitial Drainage:\nThe PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.\n\nFluid Removed: 1200 mL\nAppearance: Serous, straw-colored\n\nPleural Pressures Measured:\n\nOpening: -8 cmH\u2082O\n500ml: -10 cmH\u2082O\n1000ml: -15 cmH\u2082O\n1200ml: -18 cmH\u2082O (stopped due to chest discomfort)\n\nDrainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nPost-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Johnson underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion. Procedure completed without complications. Patient and family educated on catheter care and home drainage protocol. Drainage every other day initially, adjusting based on output. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Home health nursing arranged for first drainage. Patient given written discharge instructions and emergency contact information.",

Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.\nWe discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.\nProcedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement\nHow it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.\nThrough the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.\nMultiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.\nAfter biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.\nPathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry\nPatient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.\nFollow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.",

After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.\nInitial Bronchoscopic Survey:\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:\n\nUpper airways: Normal\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\nRight bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions\nLeft bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus\n\nTumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):\n\nLocation: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall\nSize: 1.8cm (longitudinal) \u00d7 0.9cm (circumferential extent)\nMorphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion\nColor: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization\nSurface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance\nObstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing\nDistal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:\nLaser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.\nTreatment Parameters:\n\nWavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)\nPower output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length\nDiffuser length: 2.5 cm\nTotal power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)\nLight dose (fluence): 200 J/cm\u00b2 of diffuser surface\nTreatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)\nCalculation: 200 J/cm\u00b2 \u00f7 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds\n\nLight was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:\n\nLaser energy meter verified consistent power output\nNo visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)\nNo charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)\nPatient hemodynamically stable throughout\nNo arrhythmias or desaturations\n\nPost-Treatment Assessment:\nImmediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.\nLight Precautions Review:\nPost-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:\n\nStrict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum\nWear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors\nGradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing\nEmergency contact information provided\nWritten instructions given\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient Michael Torres 59M MRN 1589403, October 15 2024, Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.",

    "note_text": "Bronchoscopy Note\nPatient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female\nDate: October 17, 2024\nDoc: Dr. Steven Park\nMRN: 1690514\nSo Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.\nBrought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).\nSo here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.\nAfter cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.\nThe distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.\nDid a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.\nRecommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.\nOverall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",

Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.\nRUSHED TO BEDSIDE\nArrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.\nSCOPE FINDINGS:\nETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.\nRIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal\nLEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.\nINITIAL MEASURES:\n\nIced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope\nSome temporary improvement but bleeding continues\nEpi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect\nTranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction\n\nBALLOON TAMPONADE:\nBlood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.\nKept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.\nSecond deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.\nFINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:\nAfter tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.\nSPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)\nPLAN:\n\nICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)\nKeep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning\nReverse any coagulopathy (check labs)\nCTA chest to identify bleeding vessel\nIR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am\nI'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR\nIf rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation\n\nUPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently.

She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:\n\nRight mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung\nMalignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)\nRight malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells\n\nThe patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING\nPre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia.

    "note_text": "OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE\nPART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)\nPatient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:\n\nCorrect patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)\nProcedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)\nPositioning (supine throughout)\nAntibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)\nSteroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)\nBlood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)\n\nInitial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.\nInitial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:\nOlympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:\n\nSupraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions\nVocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses\nSubglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis\nTrachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions\nCarina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy\nLeft main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter\nLUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent\nRight main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.\n\nDecision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.\nRigid Bronchoscopy Phase:\nPatient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.\nVentilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.\nThe rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.\nMechanical Debridement:\nUsing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.\nEstimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue\nHemostasis Measures:\nAs expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:\n\nIced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.\nTopical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.\nTranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.\n\nAfter approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.\nElectrocautery:\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.\nTreatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus\nTreatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time\nEffect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis\nArgon Plasma Coagulation:\nAPC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.\nTreatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.\nDuration: 6 minutes active APC time\nResult: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface\nAssessment after debridement:\nRight mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.\nBalloon Dilation:\nBoston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nInflation sequence:\n\nFirst inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nSecond inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nThird inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)\n\nFluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.\nPost-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.\nStent Placement:\nAfter discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.\nStent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length\nDeployment technique:\n\nStent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance\nPositioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus\nFluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views\nSlow, controlled deployment under direct visualization\nPost-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion\n\nPost-stent assessment:\nFlexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.\nFindings:\n\nStent well-positioned, no migration\nExcellent apposition to airway walls\nRUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent\nRML orifice: Visible and patent\nRLL orifice: Visible and patent\nAll segments of right lung now visualized for first time\nSignificant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nExtensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:\n\nRight upper lobe: Approximately 30mL\nRight middle lobe: Approximately 20mL\nRight lower lobe: Approximately 40mL\n\nTotal secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.\nFinal Airway Inspection:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nLeft bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent\nRight main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)\nRUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation\nMinimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent\n\nRigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).\nAirway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM\nEstimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL\nSpecimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)\n\nPART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)\nPatient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.\nTEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.\nSurgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):\n\nSubxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm\nDissection carried down to pericardium\nPericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created\nRush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid\nPericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)\nNo active bleeding from pericardial surface\n19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space\nDrain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction\n\nTEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.\n\nPART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)\nWith patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.\nUltrasound examination (performed by IP team):\n\nRight hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion\nEstimated volume: 1000-1200mL\nAnechoic fluid, no loculations\nCompressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)\n\nPleurX catheter placement:\nStandard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.\nInitial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).\nChest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.\n\nPROCEDURE CONCLUSION\nAll procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.\nPatient Status at Conclusion:\n\nHemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)\nImproved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)\nTEE shows improved cardiac function\nBilateral breath sounds now audible\n\nPatient kept intubated for transport to ICU given length of procedure and concern for post-obstructive pulmonary edema.\nSpecimens Sent:\n\nEndobronchial tumor (histology)\nBronchial secretions (bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures)\nPericardial tissue (histology, cytology)\nPericardial fluid (cytology, chemistry)\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nEstimated Total Blood Loss: 250mL\nFluids Given: 2000mL crystalloid\nUOP: 400mL\nComplications: None intraoperatively\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN\nImmediate (ICU):\n\nExtubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)\nChest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days\nMonitor pericardial drain output\nPleural catheter to drain q3 days initially\nContinue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)\nDVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ\nPPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis\nAggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry\n\nShort-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):\n\nRemove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day\nTransition to floor when stable\nContinue PleurX catheter drainage\nPain control\nPhysical therapy for reconditioning\n\nMedium-term (1-2 weeks):\n\nDischarge with home health for PleurX catheter management\nFollow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray\nDiscuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved\n\nLong-term:\n\nSurveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent\nMonitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)\nMay need stent revision/exchange\nPleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life\n\n\nASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS\nMrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:\n\nNear-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction \u2192 Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent\nCardiac tamponade physiology \u2192 Successfully addressed with pericardial window\nLarge pleural effusion \u2192 Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter\n\nAll procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:\n\nRestored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)\nResolution of cardiac compromise\nControl of pleural effusion\n\nPrognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.\nThe patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT\nI, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.\nThe procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.\nElectronically Signed: David Kim, MD - 10/25/2024 13:05\nBRONCHOSCOPY 10/27/24\nJackson Mary 82F #2145069\nIndication pneumonia not improving on abx, r/o endobronchial lesion\nModerate sedation versed 2mg fent 75mcg\nScope thru nose, lidocaine spray used\nFindings:\nNose/pharynx ok\nCords move normal\nTrachea normal\nR side all patent no lesions\nL side all patent no lesions\nDiffuse thick yellow secretions throughout both lungs\nBAL done LLL 100cc in 80cc out\nSputum cultures sent\nNo lesions seen\nPost bronch CXR no PTX\nImpression: No endobronchial cause for pneumonia, likely bacterial pneumonitis, cultures pending\nPlan: Continue abx, f/u cultures, repeat CXR 48h\nDr. Smith",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: Robert Johnson, 67-year-old Male\nMRN: 3692014\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Johnson is a 67-year-old male with a 2.8cm spiculated right lower lobe nodule discovered on screening CT. PET-avid with SUV 4.5. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (CPT 31632), Endobronchial Blocker Placement\nATTENDING: Dr. Patricia Williams\nASSISTANT: Dr. David Lee, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jessica Brown\nRT: Anthony Garcia\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: SuperDimension Navigation System, Olympus BF-1TH190 bronchoscope, 1.9mm cryoprobe, 7Fr Arndt endobronchial blocker\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 30 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nVentilation Parameters:\n\nMode: Volume Control\nRR: 12\nTV: 500mL\nPEEP: 5 cmH2O\nFiO2: 40%\nFlow Rate: 50 L/min\nPmean: 15 cmH2O\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the SuperDimension system. CT scan from 9/10/2024 was loaded onto the planning station to generate 3D rendering. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified, then loaded into the navigation platform.\nEMN Registration: Automatic registration was used. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at carina, right main carina, and RLL subsegmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 4.2mm. Global alignment quality: excellent.\nThe EMN catheter was advanced under navigational guidance to the target lesion in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (RB9). Target lesion measured 2.8cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 0.8cm from the planned target.\nRadial EBUS Survey: Performed to confirm nodule location. The following features were noted: Concentric pattern, heterogeneous echogenicity, lesion size 27mm, no large vessels visualized in the biopsy path.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy: After confirming absence of significant vessels at the biopsy site with radial EBUS, transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed using a 1.9mm cryoprobe. Freeze-thaw cycle: 6 seconds freeze, passive thaw. After each sample was obtained, the Arndt endobronchial blocker was positioned at the RLL ostium and inflated with 6cc of air for hemostasis. Total 4 samples were collected.\nAfter each biopsy, the blocker was maintained for 2 minutes, then deflated. Inspection showed minimal bleeding, which resolved spontaneously. Final inspection showed patent airways with no active bleeding.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Williams, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nRLL cryobiopsy x4 (histology)\nAdditional tissue for molecular testing\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Johnson underwent successful navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy of RLL nodule. Preliminary frozen section showed atypical cells, final pathology pending. Post-procedure CXR shows no pneumothorax. Patient to follow up in clinic in 1 week for pathology results.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.\n\nFollowing inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc\n\nRecommendation:\n\u2022 CXR to rule out pneumothorax\n\u2022 Await pathology results\n\nThomas Wright, MD\nInterventional Pulmonary\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: James Patterson\nMRN: 4726193\nDate: May 29, 2019\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation (CPT 31641)\n\nSurgeon: Patricia Lee, MD\nAssistant: Marcus Johnson, MD\nIndications: Tracheal obstruction\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\n\nOf note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer patient back to ward room\n\u2022 Await final pathology results\n\u2022 Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy\n\nI, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.\n\n________________________________________",

CT chest shows near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus by endobronchial tumor. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to therapeutic bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left mainstem bronchus obstruction secondary to endobronchial tumor\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy, Endobronchial Tumor Destruction (CPT 31641), Mechanical Tumor Debridement (CPT 31640), Airway Stent Placement (CPT 31631)\nATTENDING: Dr. Michael Anderson\nASSISTANT: Dr. Sarah Kim, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Robert Martinez\nRT: Lisa Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Thomas Wright\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: Storz rigid bronchoscope (14mm), Olympus flexible bronchoscope, Electrocautery (Bovie), APC probe, mechanical debrider, 14mm x 60mm silicone stent (Dumon)\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll\nA rigid bronchoscope (14mm) was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was utilized. A complete airway survey was performed.\nInitial Findings:\n\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nRight mainstem: Patent, mucosa normal\nLeft mainstem: 90% obstructed by friable, hemorrhagic endobronchial tumor starting 1cm distal to the carina and extending 3cm distally\n\nTherapeutic Interventions:\n1. Mechanical Debridement: The tumor was cored using the rigid bronchoscope with mechanical debridement. Multiple passes were required to remove bulk tumor. Estimated tumor volume removed: 15cc.\n2. Electrocautery: Residual tumor base was treated with electrocautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. Total treatment time: 3 minutes. FiO2 maintained at 40% during cautery.\n3. Argon Plasma Coagulation: APC was applied to residual tumor at 40 watts, argon flow 1.5 L/min. Treatment applied circumferentially to tumor base. Duration: 2 minutes.\nResults: Prior to treatment, left mainstem bronchus was 10% patent. After treatment, the airway was 70% patent.\n4. Stent Placement: Due to significant malacia and risk of re-obstruction, a 14mm x 60mm Dumon silicone stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. Stent position confirmed endoscopically with good apposition to airway wall.\nHemostasis was confirmed with minimal oozing controlled with topical epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution, 10mL instilled). A flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid barrel for final inspection showing:\n\nPatent stent lumen\nVisible LUL and LLL orifices through stent\nNo significant bleeding\n\nThe bronchoscope and adjunct instruments were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nEndobronchial tumor debridement (histology)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Chen is a 72-year-old female with squamous cell lung cancer and critical left mainstem obstruction. Successful therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor debridement, cautery, APC, and stent placement. Airway patency improved from 10% to 70%. Patient will require surveillance bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks.

Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.\n\nWe subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\n\nAt this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.\n\nPost-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to ICU\n\u2022 Obtain post-procedure CXR\n\u2022 TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent\n\nLaura Bennett, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Patient remains ventilator-dependent with anticipated prolonged intubation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to percutaneous tracheostomy were discussed with the patient's wife (patient sedated). Surrogate indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was obtained.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prolonged mechanical ventilation; ARDS\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Tracheostomy, Planned (Percutaneous, Bronchoscopic Assistance) (CPT 31600)\nATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor\nASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Amanda White\nRT: Christopher Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)\nMONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.\nWith bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nA syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.\nThe inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.\nThe Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.\nFinally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.\nThe endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S): None\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Wilson underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance. Procedure performed without complications. CXR post-procedure shows appropriate positioning without pneumothorax. Continue mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Tracheostomy care per protocol. Follow up with ICU team for ongoing management.",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nConsent: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\nPostoperative Diagnosis: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule, J44.9 COPD\n\nProcedure:\n\u2022 31624 Diagnostic bronchoscopy/lavage (BAL)\n\u2022 31628 Transbronchial biopsy single lobe\n\u2022 31629 TBNA single lobe\n\u2022 31627 Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted)\n\u2022 31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance\n\u2022 76377 3D rendering with interpretation and reporting of CT, US, Tomo modality (ION Planning Station)\n\u2022 77012 Radiology/radiologic guidance for CT guided needle placement (CIOS)\n\u2022 XU Unusual Non-Overlapping Service, the use of a service that is distinct because it does not overlap usual components of the main service\n\u2022 C7509 Diagnostic with cell washing(s) when performed, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7510 Bronchial alveolar lavage(s), with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\u2022 C7511 Single or multiple bronchial or endobronchial biopsy(ies), single or multiple sites, with computer-assisted image-guided navigation, including fluoroscopic guidance when performed\n\nAttending: Russell J. Miller, MD\nAnesthesia: General Anesthesia\nMonitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nInstrument:\n\u2022 Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\n\u2022 Ion Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nEstimated Blood Loss: Minimum\nComplications: None\n\nProcedure in Detail:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nThe therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\n\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\n\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n\nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.\n\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\n\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSpecimen(s):\n\u2022 TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture\n\u2022 BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology\n\nImpression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to PACU\n\u2022 Obtain chest X-ray\n\u2022 Discharge home once cleared by PACU\n\u2022 Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nRussell J. Miller, MD\nFebruary 11, 2025\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: Maria Rodriguez, 38-year-old Female\nMRN: 6905843\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Rodriguez is a 38-year-old female with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis presenting with progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia refractory to medical management. PFTs show restrictive pattern with DLCO 45% predicted. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to whole lung lavage were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)\nATTENDING: Dr. Richard Brown\nASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Daniel Martinez\nRT: Sarah Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus\nThe patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.\nThe bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.\nLavage Procedure:\nThe patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37\u00b0C) 0.9% normal saline.\nSerial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:\n\nAliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment\nAliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment\nAliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid\nAliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid\nAliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid\nAliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear\n\nTotal volume instilled: 6000mL\nTotal volume returned: 5820mL\nNet balance: -180mL (absorbed)\nThe effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.\nAfter completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT position was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nLavage fluid (first aliquot) sent for cell count, cytology, and periodic acid-Schiff staining\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Rodriguez underwent successful whole lung lavage of the left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Procedure completed without complications. Patient will undergo right lung lavage in 4-6 weeks pending clinical response. Post-procedure CXR shows expected mild bilateral infiltrates, no pneumothorax. Plan for 6-minute walk test and PFTs in 4 weeks to assess response. GM-CSF therapy to be discussed with pulmonology.",

    "note_text": "Patient: Brian Foster\nMRN: 6927483\nDate of Procedure: December 7, 2016\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy\n\nSurgeon: Daniel Carter, MD\nAssistant: Monica Taylor, MD\nIndications: Left mainstem obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nOn initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.\n\nAt this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.\n\nSubsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Await tissue diagnosis\n\u2022 ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung\n\u2022 If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent\n\nDaniel Carter, MD\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: Michael Thompson\nMRN: 7294163\nDate of Procedure: March 1, 2021\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement\n\nSurgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD\nIndications: Airway obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.\n\nAirway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.\n\nTumor debulking was performed using APC to \"burn and shave\" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\n\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Post-procedure x-ray\n- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance\n- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\n\nJennifer Williams, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology\nNaval Medical Center San Diego\n\n________________________________________",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.\n\nOn the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).\n\nOn the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.\n\nFollowing inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Patient to PACU for recovery\n\u2022 Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return\n\nGregory Hamilton, MD",

A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction\u2014approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.\n\nThe video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.\n\nSubsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.\n\nThe tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.\n\nPersistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.\n\nFollowing verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.\n\nComplications: None\nEstimated Blood Loss: 30 cc\n\nPost-procedure Recommendations:\n- Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid\n- Await pathology results\n- Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise\n\n________________________________________",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: Emma Thompson, 3-year-old Female\nMRN: 9238176\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Emma is a 3-year-old female presenting with sudden onset cough and wheezing 2 days ago while eating peanuts. CXR shows hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift. CT chest confirms suspected foreign body in right mainstem bronchus. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal were discussed with the patient's parents in detail. Parents indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration, right mainstem bronchus\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration (peanut fragment), right mainstem bronchus\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Foreign Body Removal\nATTENDING: Dr. Steven Martinez\nASSISTANT: Dr. Laura White, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Katherine Brown\nRT: Andrew Garcia\nAnesthesia: Dr. Michelle Chen\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended\nA 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.\nInitial Survey:\n\nLarynx: Normal\nVocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement\nTrachea: Normal caliber, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\n\nThe bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.\nForeign Body Retrieval:\nOptical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.\nThe foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.\nThe bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:\n\nRight mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material\nRight upper lobe: Patent\nRight middle lobe: Patent\nRight lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions\nLeft lung: Examined and found to be normal\n\nSecretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was identified. Final inspection showed:\n\nComplete foreign body removal\nMild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding\nPatent bilateral airways\n\nThe bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.\nThe attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nForeign body: Peanut fragment (retained for documentation)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Emma underwent successful rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal. A peanut fragment was removed from the right mainstem bronchus without complication. Post-procedure CXR ordered to confirm resolution of hyperinflation. Observe overnight with monitoring. Discharge tomorrow if stable. No bronchodilators needed. Counsel parents on choking prevention. Follow up with pediatrician in 1 week.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without any endoluminal obstruction. On the right, there was minimal structuring of the bronchus intermedius. On the left, the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially, and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded.\n\nRadial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation. However, due to the proximal obstruction, dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a guide wire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point, we performed APC to the left mainstem followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly recanalize the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly reopened, but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets. However, once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem, a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2 mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture.\n\nAt this point, to protect from major vascular bleeding, we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem, after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax. In the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation, we felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area, a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Patient to remain intubated tonight\n\u2022 CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung\n\u2022 Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery\n\u2022 Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight, place left side down, intubate right mainstem, call me (602-791-3135) and pediatric surgeon immediately\n\u2022 We will continue to follow\n\nKevin Martinez, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Esophageal stent migration through distal trachea and left mainstem\n2.         Left mainstem occlusion secondary to  esophageal stent\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n1.        Tracheoesophageal fistula status post tracheal Y-stent placement\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n1.        Rigid bronchoscopy with esophageal stent removal \n2.        Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement\n3.        Bronchoscopic intubation\nSURGEON: Jordan Parks MD\nINDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction secondary to esophageal stent migration\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   \nComplications:  Extension of TE fistula \nRecommendations:\n-        Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.\n-        Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU\n-        Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible \n-        Appreciate GI recommendations. \n-        Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware\n-        Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient\u2019s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-        If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-        Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).\n-        Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-        If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.        \nJordan Parks, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nUCLA Medical Center",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp. On the right there was mucosal changes/eryethema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared un-effected. The BI was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without There was mild structuring on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior and lateral and posterior basal segments partially obstructed from stricture (50%). On the left the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingual was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected. \nFollowing inspection we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3cm length with a 12,13.5,15 CRE balloon with post dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band like strictures within the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6,7,8 CRE balloon to the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily by passed into the segments. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  \nRecommendations:\n\u00b7\tPatient to PACU for recovery\n\u00b7\tPatient to follow-up with me PRN if symptoms return",

The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation) we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and has to convert to a 12mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.  Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.  It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression. Tumor debulking  was performed using APC to  \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved. \nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position. Post-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery. \n\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\t\n\nMaya Ellington MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nUniversity Medical Center Los Angeles",

A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction\u2014approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.\nThe video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.\nSubsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.\nThe tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.\nPersistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.\nFollowing verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.\nComplications: None\nEstimated Blood Loss: 30 cc\nPost-procedure Recommendations: \n-\tAdmit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid. \n-\tAwait pathology results. \n-\tUpon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise.",

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient\u2019s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\nPost procedure diagnosis:\n-\tStent infection\n-\tStent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.\n-\tPersistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent \n-\ts/p airway stent removal\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await cultures\n- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula\n- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.  \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the left lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 1600cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had diffuse carcinomatosis with multiple hard white pleural nodules covering the parietal and visceral pleura.  No adhesions were present Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 12 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, the pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly.\nComplications: None\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed mild post-procedural subcutaneous air with full lung re-expansion and IPC in place\nEstimated Blood Loss: 15cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion \nRecommendation:\nWill await pathology and microbiological studies\nPatient education on pleural catheter draining and will next week for initial drainage.\nJordan Parks, MD \nPulmonology Medicine\nUCLA Medical Center",

Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nSevere extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent. \nRecommendations:\n\u00b7\tTransfer to ICU\n\u00b7\tObtain post procedure CXR\n\u00b7\tTID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent",

Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation\nSURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD\nASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD\nINDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n\u2022\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n\u2022\tAwait final pathology results  \n\u2022\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy. \n \nI Aria Winslow was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure. \n \nAria Winslow MD \nInterventional Pulmonary",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\n\nATTENDING:  \nSofia Mitchell MD\n\nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nIon Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\tNone\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.\nRobotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1\u202fmm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. \nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n\nSPECIMEN(S): \nTBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.\nBAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nTransfer to PACU\nObtain chest X-ray\nDischarge home once cleared by PACU\nAwait path and culture results and based on findings f/u for EBV insertion for COPD\n\nSofia Mitchell, MD\n2/15/2024",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina\u2019s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nRecommendations:\nAwait tissue diagnosis\nASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.\nIf patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. \nIf obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",

His emphysema is predominantly in the left upper lobe with CT demonstrating 85% destruction and essentially complete fissural integrity at 98%. \n\nAfter discussing risks and benefits, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. Monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and cardiac telemetry. Moderate sedation was achieved with appropriate medications.\n\nUsing a flexible bronchoscope, I entered through the mouth and performed a systematic evaluation of the entire tracheobronchial tree. The vocal cords were normal. The trachea and carina appeared unremarkable. Both mainstem bronchi were patent. Moving to the left upper lobe, I noted the characteristic changes of severe emphysema.\n\nI proceeded with Chartis assessment of the LUL which demonstrated absent collateral ventilation - an ideal finding for valve placement. Subsequently, I placed four Zephyr endobronchial valves: one 5.5mm valve in the lingular segments, and three 4.0mm valves in the upper division bronchi. Each valve was carefully sized and positioned to ensure complete occlusion without migration risk.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure remarkably well without complications. Post-procedure imaging confirmed appropriate valve positioning and early signs of target lobe volume reduction.\n\nSarah Kim, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology\nCleveland Clinic Foundation",

However, repeat CT at 6 weeks showed migration of RB2 valve with incomplete occlusion. Patient noted return of dyspnea over past 2 weeks.\n\nIMAGING REVIEW:\nComparison CT demonstrates:\n- RB1 valve: Excellent position, maintained\n- RB2 valve: Migrated distally approximately 1.5cm  \n- RB3 valve: Excellent position, maintained\n- Result: Incomplete RUL occlusion with air flow to anterior segment\n\nPROCEDURE PLAN: Bronchoscopic valve repositioning/replacement\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation. Original anatomy reviewed. \n\nFINDINGS:\n- RB1 and RB3 valves well-seated as expected\n- RB2 valve visible but clearly malpositioned in subsegmental bronchus\n- Surrounding granulation tissue present\n\nINTERVENTION:\nUsing specialized removal forceps, the migrated RB2 valve was carefully grasped at the retention hooks. Gentle rotational torque applied while maintaining steady traction. Valve successfully removed intact without mucosal injury.\n\nBronchus re-inspected: Mild granulation tissue at original deployment site. Conservative debridement performed with cytology brush.\n\nNEW VALVE PLACEMENT:\nAfter measuring, new 5.5mm Zephyr valve (one size larger than original 4.0mm) deployed in RB2 with improved wall contact and resistance to migration. Valve delivery system technique modified to ensure more proximal placement.\n\nCONFIRMATION:\nFinal bronchoscopy confirmed all three valves in excellent position with complete RUL occlusion. No air flow detected.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Successful removal of migrated EBV\n2. Successful replacement with larger valve\n3. Complete RUL occlusion restored\n4. No complications\n\nPLAN:\n- Outpatient procedure, observe 4 hours then discharge\n- Continue prophylactic antibiotics x 5 days  \n- Repeat CT in 6 weeks\n- Close follow-up given history of migration\n\nCatherine Sullivan, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology\nMayo Clinic Rochester\n\nNote: Migration risk factors for this patient included undersizing of original valve and thin bronchial walls.

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nThe patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position, and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by ultrasound in the left 8th rib space. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nAn 18-gauge, 5 cm long echogenic percutaneous entry needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space, and fluid was aspirated to verify placement. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the needle, and the needle was then withdrawn. A 1.5 cm incision was made through the skin, and a 14 Fr dilator was advanced into the pleural space over the wire.\nThe dilator was removed, and gentle dissection with Kelly forceps was performed alongside the wire until the pleural space was entered. A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 8th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid, resulting in the removal of approximately 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe pleura had diffuse carcinomatosis, and thick adhesions were present with tethering of the lung to the chest wall. The 5 mm port was removed, and an 8 mm port was inserted in the same fashion through the original entry point. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture, with approximately five total biopsies taken. There was mild bleeding associated with the biopsies. An additional 375 cc of sanguineous fluid was then removed with suction applied through the port. Repeat examination of the pleural space showed residual bleeding had subsided.\nThe pleuroscopy telescope was then removed. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the port, and the port was withdrawn. A 14 Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain and pigtail straightening obturator were inserted into the pleural space over the wire. The obturator and wire were removed, and the drain was then immediately connected to a Pleur-Evac via the connecting tubing adapter. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and tidaling. The incision was then sutured into place with subcuticular 0 silk suture. Once the air leak had subsided, a chest X-ray was performed, which showed lung re-expansion. The chest tube was then removed, and the site was dressed with Steri-Strips, gauze, and Tegaderm.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed lung re-expansion and minimal residual effusion.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 20 cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion\nSpecimens:\n\u2022        Pleural fluid- 1275 cc (sent for cytology and microbiological analysis)\n\u2022        Pleural biopsies- 5 (sent for pathology and culture)\nRecommendation:\n\u2022        Await pathology and microbiological studies.\n\u2022        Suture removal in 2 weeks.\n\nTimothy Lundred, MD\nPulmonology Medicine\nColorado Medical Center",

The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. The left vocal cord was noted to be fixed consistent with vocal cord paralysis. Muscle relaxants were then given and we then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Airway inspection was performed and there were thick purulent secretions throughout the airways which were suctioned. In the mid to distal trachea there was approximately 30-40% obstruction from posterior extrinsic compression. The right mainstem was approximately 15% obstructed at the proximal orifice and opened up to be widely patent distally.  The right-sided airways were free of endobronchial disease in the mucosa was normal.  On the left there was significant airway obstruction beginning at the orifice of the left mainstem with friable erythematous mucosa causing approximately 40% obstruction however in the mid left mainstem there is significant protrusion of extrinsic mass with likely some degree of submucosal infiltration resulting in about 90-95% airway obstruction.  The therapeutic bronchoscope could not pass the lesion.  We then attempted to pass lesion with the diagnostic Q 190 bronchoscope and were also unsuccessful. We then again attempted to pass lesion with the ultrasound P190 bronchoscope which was successfully able to bypass lesion.  Approximately 5 mm proximal to the LC2 carina the airways open to near normal luminal diameter.  There were thick postobstructive secretions at all left-sided airways which were suctioned. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed along with the LMA and a 10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. There is a significant week which impaired ability to ventilate and multiple attempts at packing the mouth were unsuccessful.  The 10 mm rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13 mm non-ventilating tracheoscope was introduced in the airway in a similar fashion with the hope that this would eliminate/reduce the ventilator leak however similar issues arose and we subsequently decided to remove the rigid bronchoscope and perform the procedure through a 8.5 ET tube which was placed by anesthesia.  There was some hypoxia for a few minutes mostly in the mid 80s but for a short period time in the upper 70s which was likely related to the recruitment from the time period of inadequate ventilation which eventually resolved allowing us to continue with the procedure. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed however slightly too distally and was retracted into proper position with forceps. Balloon dilatation was then performed of the stent which only partially open due to significant external compression using a 10/11/12 CRE balloon which expanded the stent with only mild deformity with a subsequent diameter of the left mainstem approximately 80% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer back to ward\n-\tPost-procedure x-ray\n-\tStart 3% saline nebs 3cc combined with 2cc albuterol 3 times daily for stent maintenance. \n-\tEnsure supplemental oxygen is humidified \n-\tPlease arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge. \nRacheal Chung MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Resolving Mediastinal Mass  status post tracheal Y-stent removal\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n1.        Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with  Tracheal stent removal\nINDICATIONS: Resolved tracheal compression\nSURGEON: Mark Parsons, DO\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and thick mucus and bloody secretions were suctioned from the stent. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The trachea mucosa was friable and inflamed but without residual obstruction. The right mainstem and distal airways were normal. The left mainstem was normal however a small fractures piece of the stent was found within the left mainstem which was removed with flexible forceps without difficulty. The left sided airways were re-inspected and normal without any other residual fractured stent pieces. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. Post-procedure, the patient developed laryngospasm requiring intubation by anesthesia. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted into the posterior oropharynx and 6cc of topical 1% lidocaine was injected onto the vocal cords prior to extubation after which the patient was able to adequately ventilate prior to transfer to the PACU. \nComplications: Post-procedure laryngospasm requiring re-intubation. \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer PACU\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- Discharge to home once criteria met. \n\n\nMark Parsons, DO\nOntario Healthcare",

    "note_text": "PATIENT NAME: Rodriguez, Maria G.\nMEDICAL RECORD NUMBER: 2025-IP-9847\nDATE OF BIRTH: 03/08/1955 (Age 70 years)\nPROCEDURE DATE: October 15, 2025\nINSTITUTION: Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nFELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)\nANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nLeft lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule\n\nCLINICAL SCENARIO:\nPatient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. \n\nGeneral anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. \n\nOlympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:\n- Normal supraglottic structures\n- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy\n- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.\n\nRegistration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). \n\nSteerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.\n\nFluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).\n\nCryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:\n\nCycle 1: \n- Freeze time: 6 minutes\n- Temperature at probe tip: -165\u00b0C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20\u00b0C)\n\nCycle 2:\n- Freeze time: 6 minutes  \n- Temperature: -167\u00b0C\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes\n\nCycle 3:\n- Freeze time: 5 minutes\n- Temperature: -163\u00b0C\n- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)\n\nThroughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.\n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.\n\nCryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:\n- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)\n- No hemorrhage\n- No airway perforation\n- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)\n\nComplete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. \n\nBronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target\n2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)\n3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS\n4. No procedural complications\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nDRAINS/TUBES: None placed\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring\n2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry\n3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications\n4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging\n5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain\n6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)\n7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen\n8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake\n9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated\n10. Diet as tolerated\n11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course\n- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)\n- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation\n- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually\n\nDISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:\nExtensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.\n\nTotal procedure time: 94 minutes\nFluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  \nRadiation dose: 287 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\nATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.\n\n___________________________________________\nKevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nAssociate Professor of Medicine\nDirector of Advanced Bronchoscopy Fellowship\nDivision of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine\nStanford University School of Medicine\n\nCo-signed by:\nLisa Nguyen, MD (Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellow, PGY-6)\n\nProcedure dictated: 10/15/2025 16:45\nTranscribed: 10/15/2025 17:20\nElectronically authenticated: 10/15/2025 18:05",

Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nMODIFIED INDICATION: \nGiven active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.\n\n**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**\n\nPatient still with chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.\n\nPROCEDURE (Performed 11/08/2025, 0800hrs):\nGeneral anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.\n\nRFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:\n- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis\n- Then standard ablation (90\u00b0C x 8min) for tumor treatment\n- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment\n\nOUTCOME: \nSuccessfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None additional\n\nMODIFIED PLAN:\n- ICU monitoring continues\n- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr\n- CT chest at 48hr  \n- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved\n\n**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**\nThis represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure. Case to be presented at morbidity/mortality conference for systems review of management pathway.\n\nDr. Anthony Russo, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology - Tampa General\nAttending on call for emergent procedures\n\nCase reviewed with: Dr. Sarah Kim (Thoracic Surgery), Dr. James Liu (Interventional Radiology), Dr. Patricia Mendez (Pulmonary Critical Care)",

    "note_text": "PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Thompson, David W. | MRN: 95-847-2631 | DOB: 12/07/1951\nPROCEDURE DATE: September 28, 2025\nLOCATION: University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA\nPROCEDURALIST: Elizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP\nASSISTANT: Jennifer Lee, DO (IP Fellow, PGY-6)\nANESTHESIOLOGIST: Robert Chang, MD, MBA\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nRight lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated 09/15/2025, with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on 08/30/2025 yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above\n\nPROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:\n1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey\n2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance\n3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion\n4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule\n5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:\nThis is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.\n\nDETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.\n\nAnesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.\n\nOlympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from 09/20/2025 loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) identified and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.\n\nNavigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.\n\nCone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.\n\nExtended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90\u00b0C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.\n\nAfter completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90\u00b0C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.\n\nGuide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.\n\nAirways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution\nSPECIMENS SENT: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion\n2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones\n3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves\n4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage\n5. No immediate procedural complications identified\n\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven RLL peripheral adenocarcinoma, poor surgical candidate, status post successful bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Procedure technically successful with good positioning and ablation parameters. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary Intermediate Care Unit (7 East) for overnight observation\n2. Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry monitoring overnight\n3. Chest radiograph in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute complications\n4. CT chest with intravenous contrast in 24 hours to assess ablation zone and rule out complications\n5. Pain management: scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg q8h, oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN moderate pain, hydromorphone 0.5mg IV q4h PRN severe pain\n6. Aggressive pulmonary toilet: incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake, chest physiotherapy as needed\n7. Empiric antibiotics NOT indicated at this time given low infection risk\n8. Anticipated discharge tomorrow if overnight course uncomplicated and CT scan reassuring\n9. Follow-up arrangements: Clinic visit in 1 week with CXR, CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment, PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response\n10. Continue home medications including COPD regimen, cardiac medications\n11. Patient and family extensively counseled on post-procedure expectations, warning signs for complications (increasing dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis), importance of follow-up\n\nI have personally performed and supervised this entire procedure. All findings, interventions, and recommendations above represent my direct involvement and assessment.\n\nProcedure time: 87 minutes (includes anesthesia induction and emergence)\nFluoroscopy time: 3.2 minutes\nRadiation dose: 245 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\n_______________________________________\nElizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP\nProfessor of Medicine\nDirector, Interventional Pulmonology\nUniversity of Washington Medical Center\n\nElectronically signed: 09/28/2025 14:37 PST",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient\u2019s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty and was fully intact.  Once his stent was removed the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection. There was significant (near complete dynamic airway collapse of the trachea and mainstem bronchi as expected given known TBM.  The 1.9mm flexible cryoprobe was inserted through the working channel and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue with 30 second freeze thaw times and at least 3 activations per site. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \nComplications: None\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to PACU and then to wards\n-  Plan for stent holiday to allow healing of granulation tissue and based on symptoms possible replacement of the stent sometime in the future.  \nJessica Muller MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nHouston Hospital",

    "note_text": "PATIENT: Susan M. O'Brien\nMRN: HUP-2025-7734  \nDOB: July 4, 1961 (64 years old)\nDATE: November 2, 2025\nLOCATION: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA\nPROCEDURALIST: Dr. Michael Steinberg, MD, FCCP\nASSISTANT: Dr. Rachel Kim, DO (IP Fellow)\n\nINDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:\nMs. O'Brien is a delightful 64-year-old former librarian who presents with right middle lobe peripheral nodule discovered on CT performed for evaluation of persistent cough. Initial imaging demonstrated 2.4 cm spiculated nodule in right middle lobe lateral segment with pleural retraction. PET scan showed intense uptake with SUV max 13.4. Navigational bronchoscopy with radial EBUS-guided biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. \n\nPatient has complicated medical history including chronic kidney disease stage 4 (not on dialysis, baseline creatinine 2.9), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), and severe osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures. Thoracic surgery evaluation determined patient to be extremely high risk for lobectomy with estimated perioperative mortality exceeding 15%. Radiation oncology consulted but patient declined stereotactic body radiation therapy after extensive discussion, preferring bronchoscopic intervention.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nI met with Ms. O'Brien and her husband in the pre-procedure area. We reviewed the nature of the procedure, expected benefits, and potential risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, need for chest tube placement, bronchopleural fistula, and possible need for surgical intervention for complications. We also discussed the possibility that ablation may not completely treat the tumor and that additional therapies might be necessary. Patient and family demonstrated excellent understanding and provided informed consent.\n\nPatient brought to bronchoscopy suite at 0815. Anesthesiology team (Dr. Paul Reynolds attending) present. Standard monitoring established. Given comorbidities and anticipated procedure duration, decision made for general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.\n\nFollowing induction and intubation with 8.0 ETT, therapeutic bronchoscope advanced revealing normal appearing airway anatomy throughout. No endobronchial lesions, external compressions, or dynamic collapse noted.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation initiated using Medtronic superDimension system with prior CT imaging from 10/20/2025. Planning performed identifying target in RML lateral segment. Registration achieved with 8 reference points yielding registration accuracy of 3.1mm.\n\nGuide sheath (8.0 Fr) navigated to peripheral target location. Due to RML anatomy with somewhat straight trajectory, navigation was relatively straightforward requiring approximately 8 minutes. Radial EBUS performed confirming target lesion in solid contact position. Lesion appeared as heterogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring approximately 24 x 21mm.\n\nCone-beam CT performed confirming guide sheath position within acceptable range of target (7mm from center). Pleural surface distance measured at 18mm - appropriate safety margin for microwave ablation.\n\nMicrowave ablation antenna (Medtronic Emprint system, 15mm active tip) advanced through extended working channel to target center. Pre-ablation checklist completed including: airway clearance verified, antenna position confirmed, impedance check normal (85 ohms), safety zone confirmed without major vessels in immediate ablation field.\n\nMicrowave ablation commenced with following parameters:\n- Power: 65 watts\n- Duration: 6 minutes\n- Mode: standard tissue\n- Temperature monitoring: peak temperature 92\u00b0C at antenna tip\n\nDuring ablation, patient remained remarkably stable with no hemodynamic changes. No arrhythmias noted. Respiratory mechanics unchanged. \n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic region replacing previously hypoechoic tumor, consistent with coagulation necrosis. Ablation zone appeared to extend adequately beyond visible tumor margins.\n\nEquipment removed sequentially with careful airway inspection showing:\n- Mild erythema at peripheral catheter contact sites\n- No ulceration or mucosal disruption  \n- No hemorrhage\n- Small amount of serous fluid (<5mL)\n\nRemainder of bronchoscopy unremarkable. Patient emerged from anesthesia smoothly. Extubated after meeting standard criteria. Transferred to recovery area with oxygen saturation 93% on room air (baseline similar per chart review).\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<5mL)\nFLUIDS: 750mL crystalloid  \nCOMPLICATIONS: None during procedure\nSPECIMENS: None sent\nDEVICES: Medtronic superDimension navigation, Emprint microwave system\n\nIMPRESSION:\nTechnically successful bronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right middle lobe peripheral adenocarcinoma in 64-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities precluding surgical resection.\n\nPLAN GOING FORWARD:\nPatient admitted to pulmonary step-down unit for monitoring. Initial portable chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax. CT chest with contrast performed this evening showed appropriate ablation zone without immediate complications. Patient doing well with minimal pain (3/10) controlled with oral acetaminophen. Planning discharge tomorrow with:\n\n- Close outpatient follow-up in 1 week with repeat chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6-8 weeks for initial response assessment (expecting to see decrease in size of ablation zone with central low attenuation)  \n- PET-CT in 3 months to assess metabolic response (successful ablation should show minimal or no FDG uptake)\n- Long-term surveillance CT every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months\n\nPatient counseled extensively on post-ablation syndrome (fever, flu-like symptoms possible for 3-5 days - normal inflammatory response). Instructed on warning signs for complications. Patient and husband expressed gratitude and understanding of plan.\n\nTime spent in procedure: 78 minutes\nTime spent in pre/post procedure counseling: 35 minutes\n\nDictated and electronically signed: Michael Steinberg, MD\nDate: 11/02/2025 at 1847 hours",

The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air. The electromagnetic navigation system was utilized with successful registration to the preoperative CT scan. The guide sheath was advanced to the left upper lobe apical-posterior segment and the radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmed tool-in-lesion position with a concentric echogenic pattern consistent with solid tissue. Total fluoroscopy time was five point one minutes with a dose area product of one hundred ninety-two centigray centimeters squared. Sampling included three needle aspirations using a twenty-one gauge needle, four transbronchial forceps biopsies, and two brush cytology specimens. There was minimal bleeding after the forceps biopsies which resolved spontaneously with gentle suction. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax or significant change from baseline. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home after two hours of observation in stable condition.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle bronchi had stent in place with minimal mucous but granulation tissue the distal edge causing 50% obstruction. The right lower lobe bronchi stent was partially obstructed with thick yellow mucous. Using saline flushes and suction we were able to remove mucous. The right middle lobe stent was then grasped with flexible forceps by the proximal string and retracted. The stent was easily removed. There was significant inflammation and malacia at site of previous stent. The bronchoscope was advanced beyond the stenotic segment and the medial and lateral segments were visualized and intact.  The Right lower lobe stent was then removed in a similar fashion to the RML stent without difficulty. In the previous bed there was extensive inflammation and granulation tissue causing >50% obstruction of the airway. The bronchoscope was pushed through the obstruction using saline flushes and the distal basilar segments were visualized and intact. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were debulked with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps. During this process the superior segment of the RLL was visualized with sub-segments intact. There remained significant obstruction and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue using repetitive 30 second freeze thaw cycles. This was performed in a similar manner in the RML. Finally, using an 8-9-10 CRE dilatational balloon we were able to gently dilate the effected bronchi to increased luminal diameter. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful removal of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with significant residual granulation tissue.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- D/C when criteria met\n- Ok to return to Hawaii on Monday if asymptomatic over weekend. \n- Recommend repeat flexible bronchoscopy with pulmonologist at Tripler within the next week to remove debris following cryotherapy. \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight\n- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.\n- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray \n- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center",

The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea and right sided airways were normal. The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.  At the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.  Distal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.  Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.  All of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.  At this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.  The first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.  The second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.  Finally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.  At this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.  Using flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.  Subsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.  At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.  Then, using a 8\u20139\u201310 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.  Cryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.  Finally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue. \nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-        Transfer patient back to the ICU\n-        Post-procedure x-ray\n-        Patient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis.  \nJordan Parks MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nGeneral anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.\n\nABLATION PARAMETERS:\n- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds\n- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  \n- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz\n- Number of treatment cycles: 3\n- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds\n- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)\n- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:\nAdvanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).\n\nOUTCOMES: \nSuccessfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.\n\nNOVEL FINDINGS: \nPFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.\n\nDISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis. Patient enrolled in long-term registry (5-year follow-up).\n\nResearch coordinator contacted. Data forms completed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nStudy PI: Richard Patel, MD\nProtocol: PULSE-LUNG-002",

Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL APPROACH:\nGiven the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.\n\nSedation Protocol:\nDeep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.\n\nTechnical Details:\nThe electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension\u2122) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.\n\nThe extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.\n\nRadiation Exposure:\nTotal fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes\nDose-area product: 268 cGy\u00b7cm\u00b2\n(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)\n\nSampling Protocol:\nFollowing tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:\n- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens\n- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nSmall apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.\n\nQUALITY METRICS:\n- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved\n- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)\n- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete\n- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology\n\nDISCUSSION:\nThis case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",

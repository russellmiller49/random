    "note_text": "INDICATIONS: Completed stent trial\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 13 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sublottic glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient\u2019s uncovered Ultraflex SEM stents in the trachea and bilateral main stems were widely patent with minimal intraluminal mucous. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optic was reinserted alongside rigid alligator forceps. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed the 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope and advanced to the distal trachea at which point the left and right main stem stents were also removed in a similar fashion, flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection.  There was moderate inflammation with slight granulation issue in the mucosa surrounding the previous stents with slow oozing of blood most predominantly in the distal trachea and main stem bronchi. There was also marked residual malacia which required conversion from open jet ventilation to closed conventional ventilation to main stem airway patency. The areas of active oozing were then treated with APC painting of the mucosa until sufficient hemostasis was achieved. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \n\nRecommendations:\nTransfer to PACU\nDischarge patient once criteria is met\nFollow-up with CT surg regarding planned surgical tracheoplasty",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the ET tube into the tracheobronchial tree.   Tracheomalacia was noted in the trachea. The carina was sharp. The right-sided airway anatomy was normal. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L  (5.4mm) and 4R (5.5mm) lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by 4R lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE showed non-diagnostic tissue in the low probability 11L lymph node and benign lymphocytes in the 4Rs. All samples were sent for routine cytology. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results",

    "note_text": "Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer\nMedications: General Anesthesia\nTopical: 80mg of lidocaine (8cc of 1%)\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords were normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Left sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions. The right mainstem, right upper lobe and proximal 80% of the bronchus intermedius was normal caliber without endobronchial lesions or mucosal irregularities. Mild extrinsic compression was present in the distal 20% of the bronchus intermedius. There was submucosal infiltration in the right middle lobe take off however it was widely patent. In the right lower lobe bronchus (just past the middle lobe take off) there was approximately 75% airway obstruction from a combination of submucosal infiltration and extrinsic tumor compression. The superior segment of the right lower lobe was 100% occluded. The bronchoscope was advanced past the obstruction which was about 1.5 cm in length and the basilar segments appeared uninvolved and were widely patent. \nThe video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L( 5.7mm), 7( 7.8mm) , !!rs (12.5 mm)  and 11Ri lymph nodes. The 11Ri lymph node was continuous with the primary tumor and involved by direct extension. The lymph node/mass was measured at 28.0 mm on ultrasonography. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node and finally the 11Ri/mass. The 11Rs was not sampled as this would not affect stage given the 11Ri involvement.  A total of 5 biopsies were performed in the 11L and 7 lymph node stations. Rapid on-site assessment of the station 11L was non-diagnostic (however low probability node so further sampling was not performed), and station 7 was normal lymphocytes. The 11Ri/mass was malignant favoring squamous cell carcinoma based on ROSE. A total of 9 needle passes were performed to ensure adequate material for PD L-1 and next generation sequencing with the majority of passes placed directly into cell block.  All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc\nPost Procedure: presumed lung cancer\nAssessment/Plan: \n- Technically successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging examination.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. A brown plaque of unclear significance was seen on the epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R and station 11Rs lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4r Lymph node, followed by 11Rs using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results\n- Plan for CT guided biopsy of RLL lesion on 6/20/17\n- Will refer to ENT for evaluation of mucosal plaque seen on epiglottis.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords were normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the right upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.  After adequate samples were obtained, the video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11L, 7, 4R lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node and finally the 4R lymph node. A total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with RUL and endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results",

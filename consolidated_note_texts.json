A 15mm skin incision was made at the insertion point.\n\nUsing the Rocket Medical tunneling system, a 12cm subcutaneous tunnel was created from the insertion site anteriorly toward the anterior axillary line. The Rocket IPC was threaded through the tunnel with the Dacron cuff positioned approximately 2cm from the exit site to promote tissue ingrowth.\n\nThe pleural space was accessed using modified Seldinger technique. Real-time ultrasound confirmed the guidewire position in the pleural space. The dilator and peel-away sheath were introduced, and the 15.5Fr Rocket catheter was advanced into the pleural space. The position was confirmed with aspiration of clear, straw-colored fluid.\n\n1,800mL of transudative-appearing fluid was drained. Pleural fluid samples sent for cell count, chemistry, culture, and cytology. The catheter was secured with 2-0 Prolene sutures. Exit site dressed with sterile gauze and Tegaderm.\n\nPost-procedure CXR showed catheter tip in dependent right hemithorax, significant improvement in effusion, no pneumothorax.\n\nFINDINGS:\n- Large free-flowing right pleural effusion\n- Transudative appearing fluid\n- No loculations or septations\n- Catheter positioned in posterior dependent space\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: <5mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Admitted for overnight observation given hepatic encephalopathy risk with large volume drainage.

Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Balloon dilation of tracheal stenosis\n3. Biodegradable tracheal stent placement (BD-Stent, Merit Endotek)\n\nINDICATION: 51-year-old male with history of prolonged intubation (28 days) for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 in 2021. Developed tracheal stenosis requiring multiple dilations. Has failed 3 prior balloon dilations with recurrence within 4-6 weeks. After discussion of options including T-tube, surgical resection, and biodegradable stent, patient elected for biodegradable stent trial given relatively young age and desire to avoid permanent stent or surgery.\n\nANESTHESIA: Total intravenous anesthesia (propofol/remifentanil)\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nUnder TIVA, rigid bronchoscopy carried out using 12mm Storz ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Airway anatomy:\n- Subglottic region: Normal\n- Tracheal stenosis: Located 2.5cm below vocal cords, approximately 8mm thick web-like stenosis narrowing the lumen to 5mm (Grade III, Myer-Cotton)\n- Distal trachea and bilateral mainstem: Normal\n\nBalloon dilation carried out using 15mm x 40mm CRE balloon (Boston Scientific). Balloon inflated to 8 ATM x 60 seconds x 3 inflations with radial fracturing of the stenosis observed. Post-dilation diameter approximately 12mm.\n\nMerit Endotek BD-Stent (18mm diameter x 30mm length, polydioxanone-based) selected based on tracheal measurements. Stent delivery system maneuvered through the rigid bronchoscope and placed under direct visualization with the proximal and distal markers positioned 1cm beyond the stenosis margins. Stent expanded fully to approximately 16mm. Confirmation of good apposition to tracheal wall.\n\nPost-procedure bronchoscopy verified clear airway through the stent with no evidence of stent migration. Mucosa intact with minimal bleeding from dilation site.\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: <5mL\n\nDISPOSITION: PACU recovery, discharge home same day with post-procedure instructions. No activity restrictions. Soft diet x 24 hours.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n- Bronchoscopy in 8 weeks for stent assessment\n- BD-Stent expected to degrade over 4-6 months\n- CT airway in 3 months\n\nDr. Rachel Kim, MD\nDr. Ahmed Hassan, MD"

Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC\n\nINDICATION: 69-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was placed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius patent\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent\n\nFinal inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally.

CT chest showed bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud opacities. Sputum cultures pending. Bronchoscopy for airway inspection and clearance of blood/secretions.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemoptysis, likely infectious etiology vs bronchiectasis\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions; no endobronchial lesion or active bleeding source identified\n\nPROCEDURE: Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning\n\nSEDATION: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 50mcg IV)\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nThe patient was sedated and the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-P190) was introduced via the oropharynx. The vocal cords appeared normal without lesions or edema. The trachea was patent with normal mucosa. Carina was sharp.\n\nAIRWAY FINDINGS:\n- Right mainstem: Patent. Old blood coating the mucosa.\n- Right upper lobe: Multiple segments with thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood. Significant bronchiectatic changes. No endobronchial lesions. No active bleeding visualized.\n- Bronchus intermedius: Patent with mild inflammation\n- Right middle lobe: Mucopurulent secretions, no masses\n- Right lower lobe: Bronchiectatic changes, thick secretions\n- Left mainstem: Patent, old blood noted\n- Left upper lobe: Similar bronchiectatic changes with mucopurulent secretions. No tumor or active bleeding.\n- Lingula: Mild secretions\n- Left lower lobe: Bronchiectasis, mucopurulent secretions, no source of bleeding identified\n\nTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:\nExtensive suctioning performed throughout all visualized airways. Large quantities of thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood were cleared from bilateral bronchi. No single bleeding source could be identified - the hemoptysis appears to be diffuse from inflamed bronchiectatic airways.\n\nNo biopsy was performed as no discrete lesion identified. No BAL performed as secretions already sent from suctioning.\n\nSPECIMENS: \n- Bronchial aspirate/secretions: Bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB culture, cytology\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None. No active bleeding during or after procedure.\n\nEBL: Trace\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE: Patient tolerated well. No respiratory distress. CXR unchanged from pre-procedure.\n\nIMPRESSION & PLAN:\n1. Diffuse bilateral bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions - no discrete bleeding source identified\n2. Hemoptysis likely from diffuse bronchiectatic mucosal inflammation with superimposed infection\n3. No endobronchial malignancy identified\n4. Continue empiric antibiotics pending cultures\n5. Pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy\n6. Follow-up in 2 weeks; consider repeat CT if hemoptysis persists\n\nDr. Jennifer Liu, MD\nPulmonary/Critical Care",

Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)\n2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)\n3. VATS lysis of adhesions\n4. VATS pleural biopsy\n5. Decortication (partial)\n6. Chest tube placement\n\nINDICATION: 64-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest revealed large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 showed exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\n\nMEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):\nPatient positioned in left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.\n\nA 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.\n\nDECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.\n\nVATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):\nThe incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was identified. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.\n\nFindings:\n- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout\n- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung\n- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)\n- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained\n\nMultiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.\n\nA 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase\n- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively.

Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)\n2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)\n3. VATS lysis of adhesions\n4. VATS pleural biopsy\n5. Decortication (partial)\n6. Chest tube placement\n\nINDICATION: 67-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest demonstrated large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 demonstrated exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\n\nMEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):\nPatient positioned in left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination demonstrated a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.\n\nA 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely passed due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.\n\nDECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.\n\nVATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):\nThe incision was extended and a 10mm port positioned under direct vision where a small pleural space was found. Two additional 5mm ports were positioned. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was accomplished over approximately 90 minutes.\n\nFindings:\n- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout\n- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung\n- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)\n- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained\n\nMultiple parietal pleural biopsies were gathered from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was accomplished to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.\n\nA 28Fr chest tube was positioned. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase\n- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively. Conversion was planned contingency.\n\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to SICU for overnight monitoring. Chest tube to suction.\n\nPOST-OPERATIVE PLAN:\n1. Monitor chest tube output\n2. CXR in AM\n3. Await pathology - concern for malignant mesothelioma or chronic fibrinous pleuritis\n4. If lung remains trapped, may require chronic indwelling pleural catheter\n\nDr. Mark Anderson, MD - Interventional Pulmonology\nDr. Sarah Kim, MD - Thoracic Surgery"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 02/23/2025, Virginia Richardson, a 79-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 27 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.0 millimeters in short axis and 23.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.7 millimeters in short axis and 13.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.8 millimeters in short axis and 24.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.0 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 08:45, for a total procedure time of 75 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions.

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 07/08/2024, Stephen Foster, a 74-year-old female patient, presented to Methodist Hospital in Cleveland, OH for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Katherine Lee, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was left lower lobe nodule and subcarinal adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 29.8 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 43 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.4 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 21.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.1 millimeters in short axis and 30.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:58, for a total procedure time of 103 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nKatherine Lee, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/18/2025, Emma Jones, a 64-year-old male patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Andrew Nakamura, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 25.0 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.6. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.5 millimeters in short axis and 24.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.1 millimeters in short axis and 17.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.1 millimeters in short axis and 27.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.5 millimeters in short axis and 24.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:33, for a total procedure time of 123 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions.

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 12/15/2024, Gregory Perry, a 54-year-old male patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 31.9 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the anteromedial basal (B7+8) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 57 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.6 millimeters in short axis and 19.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.5 millimeters in short axis and 12.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.8 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 14.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 18.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:14, for a total procedure time of 119 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nMaria Santos, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/17/2025, Nancy Gray, a 72-year-old female patient, presented to Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, MN for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was mediastinal staging for biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 22.6 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the apical (B1) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:45.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.9 millimeters in short axis and 17.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.0 millimeters in short axis and 24.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.1 millimeters in short axis and 15.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL apical (B1). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:56, for a total procedure time of 131 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nBrian O'Connor, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 01/23/2024, Joyce Sullivan, a 77-year-old female patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Jennifer Walsh, MD, with Marcus Williams assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.2 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 55 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:45.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 15.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.4 millimeters in short axis and 22.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.6 millimeters in short axis and 18.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:30, for a total procedure time of 105 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nJennifer Walsh, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 07/01/2025, Julie Mitchell, a 82-year-old male patient, presented to Academic Health System in Miami, FL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Rachel Goldman, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 14.0 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the apicoposterior (B1+2) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 17.6. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.8 millimeters in short axis and 28.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.3 millimeters in short axis and 25.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.9 millimeters in short axis and 30.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.8 millimeters in short axis and 34.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.7 millimeters in short axis and 20.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:09, for a total procedure time of 114 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nRachel Goldman, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 01/02/2025, Brandon Reed, a 56-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Miami, FL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Amanda Foster, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 27.1 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.1. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 9.1 millimeters in short axis and 13.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.9 millimeters in short axis and 15.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.2 millimeters in short axis and 25.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:03, for a total procedure time of 108 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nAmanda Foster, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 12/15/2024, Heather Flores, a 57-year-old female patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital in Phoenix, AZ for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.9 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 58 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 9.9 millimeters in short axis and 21.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 21.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:40, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nDavid Kim, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/25/2024, Gregory Flores, a 63-year-old female patient, presented to University Medical Center in Philadelphia, PA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Steven Park, MD, with Emily Chen assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 34.7 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the superior lingula (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 29 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:00.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.3 millimeters in short axis and 24.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.4 millimeters in short axis and 15.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.1 millimeters in short axis and 15.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL superior lingula (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:02, for a total procedure time of 122 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nSteven Park, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/25/2024, Larry Anderson, a 82-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.8. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 25 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.9 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 27.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.1 millimeters in short axis and 28.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:05, for a total procedure time of 125 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nLisa Thompson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/13/2024, Jerry Morris, a 52-year-old male patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Atlanta, GA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Marcus Williams assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 20.0 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the medial (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.5. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 23 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:45.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 21.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 23.9 millimeters in short axis and 31.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.6 millimeters in short axis and 30.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.4 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML medial (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - nsclc nos. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 12:12, for a total procedure time of 87 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nDavid Kim, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/02/2024, Timothy Patel, a 64-year-old female patient, presented to Methodist Hospital in New York, NY for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 14.5 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 50 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.3 millimeters in short axis and 31.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 10.0 millimeters in short axis and 26.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.9 millimeters in short axis and 12.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported atypical cells. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:31, for a total procedure time of 136 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nBrian O'Connor, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 06/18/2025, Noah White, a 74-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital in Atlanta, GA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Rachel Goldman, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 20.2 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the inferior lingula (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 43 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:45.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.4 millimeters in short axis and 26.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.3 millimeters in short axis and 30.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.4 millimeters in short axis and 33.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.3 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL inferior lingula (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:38, for a total procedure time of 113 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis.

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/11/2025, Samantha Williams, a 41-year-old male patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Robert Patel, MD, with Priya Sharma assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 24.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the superior lingula (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 49 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.8 millimeters in short axis and 15.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL superior lingula (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:18, for a total procedure time of 108 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nRobert Patel, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 05/26/2025, Thomas Henderson, a 45-year-old male patient, presented to Academic Health System in Phoenix, AZ for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Sarah Chen, MD, with Emily Chen assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.2 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the inferior lingula (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.1 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.8 millimeters in short axis and 16.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.4 millimeters in short axis and 34.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 10.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL inferior lingula (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:08, for a total procedure time of 98 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nSarah Chen, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 06/27/2025, Noah Mitchell, a 72-year-old female patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Denver, CO for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Steven Park, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 27.5 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.3. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.0 millimeters in short axis and 13.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.9 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:10, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nSteven Park, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/17/2024, Paul Perez, a 53-year-old female patient, presented to Cleveland Clinic in Boston, MA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Marcus Williams assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 31.2 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the inferior lingula (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 5.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.6 millimeters in short axis and 13.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.5 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.0 millimeters in short axis and 19.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.8 millimeters in short axis and 17.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.9 millimeters in short axis and 29.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL inferior lingula (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 08:33, for a total procedure time of 78 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nBrian O'Connor, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 03/30/2025, Joshua Bennett, a 50-year-old female patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Miami, FL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Eric Johnson, MD, with Priya Sharma assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 19.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 54 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.2 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.8 millimeters in short axis and 22.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 31.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported granuloma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:41, for a total procedure time of 131 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nEric Johnson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 10/30/2025, Elizabeth Morgan, a 79-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 31.5 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the medial (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 7.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 57 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 23.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.3 millimeters in short axis and 14.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.1 millimeters in short axis and 33.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML medial (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:15, for a total procedure time of 105 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nLisa Thompson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 10/06/2024, Jonathan Wood, a 54-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in Dallas, TX for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Michael Rodriguez, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 28.6 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 8.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 36 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.1 millimeters in short axis and 25.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.4 millimeters in short axis and 34.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.2 millimeters in short axis and 34.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.9 millimeters in short axis and 28.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.5 millimeters in short axis and 22.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:02, for a total procedure time of 92 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nMichael Rodriguez, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 10/01/2025, Dorothy Price, a 53-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital in Cleveland, OH for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Andrew Nakamura, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 23 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.4 millimeters in short axis and 23.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 20.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.2 millimeters in short axis and 34.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:49, for a total procedure time of 94 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nAndrew Nakamura, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 10/10/2025, Susan Rodriguez, a 46-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Boston, MA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 46 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.3 millimeters in short axis and 24.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 23.0 millimeters in short axis and 31.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:49, for a total procedure time of 79 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nLisa Thompson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 07/28/2024, Margaret Ortiz, a 64-year-old female patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital in Houston, TX for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Robert Patel, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 21.6 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 41 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.0 millimeters in short axis and 14.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.7 millimeters in short axis and 23.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.4 millimeters in short axis and 27.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported granuloma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:40, for a total procedure time of 85 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nRobert Patel, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 12/14/2024, Jennifer Miller, a 54-year-old female patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the medial basal (B7) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.0 millimeters in short axis and 33.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.9 millimeters in short axis and 26.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.9 millimeters in short axis and 22.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.9 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL medial basal (B7). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 12:49, for a total procedure time of 139 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nDavid Kim, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 09/14/2024, Stephanie King, a 51-year-old male patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Chicago, IL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Steven Park, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.9 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 20 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.3 millimeters in short axis and 28.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.8 millimeters in short axis and 23.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.9 millimeters in short axis and 20.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.0 millimeters in short axis and 28.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.0 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported granuloma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:32, for a total procedure time of 77 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nSteven Park, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 08/24/2024, Ronald Henderson, a 67-year-old male patient, presented to UCLA Medical Center in Dallas, TX for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 27.1 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 15.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.2 millimeters in short axis and 30.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.2 millimeters in short axis and 31.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.6 millimeters in short axis and 19.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.2 millimeters in short axis and 15.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.9 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported atypical cells. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:55, for a total procedure time of 85 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nDavid Kim, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 06/22/2024, Anthony Price, a 50-year-old female patient, presented to St. Luke's Medical Center in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Eric Johnson, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 19.5 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 5.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.4 millimeters in short axis and 28.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.1 millimeters in short axis and 19.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.6 millimeters in short axis and 28.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.2 millimeters in short axis and 33.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - nsclc nos. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:46, for a total procedure time of 91 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nEric Johnson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 11/26/2025, Jason Gomez, a 60-year-old male patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 15.4 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 4.3. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 47 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:00.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.1 millimeters in short axis and 29.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.5 millimeters in short axis and 25.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.6 millimeters in short axis and 19.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.8 millimeters in short axis and 27.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported atypical cells. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:45, for a total procedure time of 105 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nBrian O'Connor, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

        "note_text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn 08/10/2024, Ashley Sanders, a 68-year-old male patient, presented to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Cleveland, OH for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 29.4 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 43 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.5 millimeters in short axis and 31.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 14.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.5 millimeters in short axis and 29.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:36, for a total procedure time of 81 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nBrian O'Connor, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"

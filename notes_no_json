            2: "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient presented with a recurrent pleural effusion suspicious for malignancy. Under general anesthesia, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was initiated. Inspection of the hemithorax revealed distinct areas of nodularity and plaque formation along the posterior parietal pleura. Nine biopsies were obtained utilizing rigid forceps for histological characterization. Subsequently, to prevent fluid reaccumulation, a talc poudrage and slurry were instilled into the pleural space to effect pleurodesis.",

            5: "Patient here for the lung fluid thing. Did the VATS 2 ports. Saw some weird plaques on the back wall took a bunch of bites like 9 of them. Then put the talc in for the pleurodesis to stick the lung up. No bleeding really. Chest tube in securely. Woke up fine.",
            6: "Thoracoscopy performed under general anesthesia. Upon entering the pleural space significant fluid was drained. Inspection showed areas of isolated nodularity and plaques on the parietal pleura chest wall posterior. Rigid forceps used to take 9 biopsies. Electroautery knife used for additional sampling.

            8: "The patient was brought to the operating room for management of their recurrent pleural effusion. We performed a video-assisted thoracoscopy. Once the fluid was cleared, we noted several plaques and nodules on the chest wall. We carefully took nine biopsy samples from these areas. Following the biopsies, we instilled talc to induce pleurodesis and prevent the fluid from coming back. A chest tube was left in place.",
            9: "Procedure: Video-assisted pleural sclerosis.\nFindings: Parietal pleural thickening and distinct plaques.\nAction: The lesions were sampled extensively using grasping forceps.

Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.\u00a0 The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered. \u00a0 Fluid Removed: 450_ ml \u200c \u00a0Serous \u00a0\u200c Serosanguinous X \u200c Bloody\u00a0 \u200c Chylous \u200c Other: \u00a0 Pleural pressures:\u00a0\u00a0If not measured, please check here \u200cX Opening:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 500 ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 1000ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 2000ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Drainage device:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Pleurovac\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Drainage Bag\u00a0 \u200c Heimlich Valve\u00a0 X \u200c Pneumostat\u00a0\u200c Other: Suction: \u200c X No \u200cYes, - ___ cmH20 \u00a0 CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X \u200c Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Right \u200c Left \u00a0 Pleural Effusion: Volume:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c None\u00a0 \u200c X Minimal\u00a0\u200c Small\u00a0 \u200c Moderate\u00a0 \u200c Large Echogenicity:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c X Anechoic\u00a0 \u200c Hypoechoic\u00a0 \u200c Isoechoic\u00a0\u200c Hyperechoic Loculations:\u00a0 \u200c X None\u00a0 \u200cThin\u00a0 \u200c Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X \u200c Normal\u00a0 \u200c Diminished\u00a0\u200c Absent\u00a0 Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X\u00a0 \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: \u200c Present \u00a0X\u200c\u00a0Absent Pleura: \u200c Normal\u00a0\u200c Thick\u00a0 X \u200c Nodular \u00a0 SPECIMEN(S): \u200cX \u00a0LDH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200cGlucose\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cT.

Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion.

Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.\u00a0 The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered. \u00a0 Fluid Removed: 1850_ ml \u200cX \u00a0Serous \u00a0\u200c Serosanguinous \u200c Bloody\u00a0 \u200c Chylous \u200c Other: \u00a0 Pleural pressures:\u00a0\u00a0If not measured, please check here \u200cX Opening:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 500 ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 1000ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500ml:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20\u00a0\u00a0 2000ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cmH20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Drainage device:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cX Pleurovac\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c Drainage Bag\u00a0 \u200c Heimlich Valve\u00a0 \u200c Pneumostat\u00a0\u200c Other: Suction: \u200c X No \u200cYes, - ___ cmH20 \u00a0 CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: X \u200c Image saved and uploaded to epic media tab Hemithorax:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Right \u200c Left \u00a0 Pleural Effusion: Volume:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c None\u00a0 \u200c X Minimal\u00a0\u200c Small\u00a0 \u200c Moderate\u00a0 \u200c Large Echogenicity:\u00a0\u00a0 \u200c X Anechoic\u00a0 \u200c Hypoechoic\u00a0 \u200c Isoechoic\u00a0\u200c Hyperechoic Loculations:\u00a0 \u200c X None\u00a0 \u200cThin\u00a0 \u200c Thick Diaphragmatic Motion: X \u200c Normal\u00a0 \u200c Diminished\u00a0\u200c Absent\u00a0 Lung: Lung sliding before procedure:\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung sliding post procedure: X\u00a0 \u200c Present\u00a0\u200c Absent Lung consolidation/atelectasis: \u200c Present \u00a0X\u200c\u00a0Absent Pleura: X \u200c Normal\u00a0\u200c Thick\u00a0 \u200c Nodular \u00a0 SPECIMEN(S): \u200cX \u00a0LDH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X \u200cGlucose\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 X\u00a0\u00a0 \u200cT.

Mechanical coring was performed with the rigid barrel, supplemented by Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for hemostasis and tissue destruction (CPT 31641). Following balloon dilation, a 14x60mm partially covered self-expanding metallic stent was deployed (CPT 31636), restoring patency to the RUL, RML, and RLL. Subsequently, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was inserted for palliation of malignant effusion (CPT 32550).",

We took a sample to confirm the diagnosis and then placed several small gold markers, or fiducials, directly into the tumor. These will act as targets for the radiation machine to treat the cancer precisely.",

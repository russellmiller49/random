RUL nodule 2.1cm, LUL nodule 1.6cm. Both PET avid (SUV 3.4 and 2.9 respectively). No lymphadenopathy. Patient referred for tissue diagnosis.\n\n**MEDICATIONS:**\nHome meds held per protocol. No anticoagulation.\n\n**PROCEDURE SUMMARY:**\n\nPre-procedure CT (02/28/2025) loaded to Ion system. Dual-target navigation plan created for sequential sampling of RUL and LUL nodules.\n\nPatient received general anesthesia. ETT size 7.5 at 21cm at lips.\n\nVent Settings: VC mode, TV 420mL, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 60%, Flow rate 50L/min, Pmean 12cmH2O\n\n**ION REGISTRATION - COMPLETE:**\nRegistration using automatic method. Landmarks matched: carina, bilateral lobar carinas, segmental bifurcations RUL/LUL. Mean fiducial error 0.9mm. Excellent global alignment. No registration drift observed.\n\n**TARGET 1 - RUL ANTERIOR SEGMENT NODULE:**\n\nIon catheter navigated to RUL anterior segment. Tool-at-target confirmed by:\n- Navigation software showing 0.5cm distance\n- Radial EBUS concentric pattern, 19mm lesion\n- Fluoroscopy AP/lateral projections\n\nSamples:\n- Forceps biopsy x6\n- Brushings x2\n- Washing sent for cytology\n\nROSE: Atypical pneumocytes, favor adenocarcinoma. Final pending.\n\n**TARGET 2 - LUL APICAL-POSTERIOR SEGMENT NODULE:**\n\nCatheter repositioned to LUL. Navigation time from RUL target to LUL target: 8 minutes.\n\nRadial EBUS: eccentric pattern initially, adjusted catheter position, achieved concentric pattern. Lesion 14mm.\n\nSamples:\n- Forceps biopsy x5\n- Brushings x2\n\nROSE: Similar to RUL - atypical cells concerning for malignancy.\n\n**PROCEDURE COMPLETION:**\n\nTotal procedure time: 62 minutes\nTotal navigation time: 47 minutes\nCombined registration + navigation time to first nodule: 18 minutes\n\nHemostasis verified. Airways cleared. Patient extubated successfully, to recovery in stable condition.\n\nPost-op CXR: No pneumothorax\n\n**ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful bilateral lung nodule sampling via robotic bronchoscopy. ROSE suggests possible synchronous primary lung cancers vs metastatic disease. Await final pathology. If malignant, will need PET/CT, brain MRI staging. Discussion at thoracic tumor board.\n\n**FOLLOW-UP:** IP clinic 2 weeks\n\nDr. Christopher Hayes, Attending - electronically signed 03/12/2025 17:20\n**BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NOTE**\n\nPatient Identifier: Williams, Robert D. | 71M | MRN 9284756\nDate of Service: 10/18/2024\nPhysician: Dr. Laura Martinez, Interventional Pulmonology\nFellow Physician: Dr. Ahmed Hassan\n\n**Indication:** LLL nodule 2.8cm, hypermetabolic on PET scan\n\n**Procedure:** Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and radial EBUS\n\n**Consent:** Obtained after discussion of risks including pneumothorax (~2%), bleeding (~1%), infection, need for additional procedures\n\n**Sedation:** Moderate conscious sedation - Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 100mcg IV.

May return to work in 1-2 days as tolerated\n**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**\n\n**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**\n\n**Primary Tumor:**\n- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed\n\n**Lymph Node Staging:**\n- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)\n- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)\n- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)\n\n**Preliminary Staging:**\n- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)\n- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)\n- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)\n- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**\n\nThis represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.\n**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**\n\n**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe\n\n**Significance:**\n- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement\n- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards\n- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease\n- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation\n\n**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**\n- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis\n- Good performance status (ECOG 1)\n- Age 61 - relatively young\n- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)\n\n**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**\n- Stage IIIB with N3 disease\n- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)\n- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)\n\n**Treatment Implications:**\n- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)\n- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy \u2192 radiation, or clinical trial\n- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations\n- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease\n- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:\n  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation\n  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection\n  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options\n\n**Awaiting:**\n- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)\n- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)\n- Formal staging completion (see below)\n**PLAN & FOLLOW-UP:**\n\n**1. Staging Completion:**\n- **Brain MRI with contrast** - Order STAT (high priority in adenocarcinoma, screen for brain metastases which would upstage to Stage IV)\n- Review PET/CT from 04/02/2025:\n  - Confirm adequate coverage of chest/abdomen/pelvis\n  - No suspicious distant lesions\n  - If any concerning findings, consider dedicated imaging\n- Consider bone scan if bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase (though PET usually adequate)\n\n**2. Pathology & Molecular Testing:**\n- Monitor for final pathology report (should be available 04/18 or 04/19)\n- **EXPEDITE molecular testing** - contact pathology to prioritize\n  - EGFR, ALK, ROS1 (highest priority)\n  - PD-L1 (critical for immunotherapy decisions)\n  - Broader NGS panel\n- Call patient with preliminary results once available\n\n**3. Multidisciplinary Tumor Board:**\n- **Present case at Thoracic Oncology Tumor Board** - Next meeting 04/23/2025\n- Ensure molecular testing results available before tumor board if possible\n- Invitees: Medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery (for completeness), interventional pulmonology, radiology, pathology\n\n**4. Consultations:**\n- **Medical Oncology** - Referral placed to Dr. Jennifer Martinez\n  - Urgent appointment requested (within 1 week)\n  - Discuss systemic therapy options\n  - Clinical trial consideration\n- **Radiation Oncology** - Referral placed to Dr. Robert Kim\n  - For definitive radiation planning\n  - Coordination with medical oncology for concurrent vs sequential approach\n\n**5. Patient Follow-Up:**\n- **Interventional Pulmonology clinic appointment: 04/23/2025 at 2:00 PM**\n  - Review final pathology\n  - Review molecular testing (if available)\n  - Discuss staging results\n  - Coordinate care with oncology\n  - Answer questions, provide support\n- **Patient phone call in 2-3 days:**\n  - Check on post-procedure recovery\n  - Provide preliminary results\n  - Ensure patient connected with oncology\n  - Address immediate concerns\n\n**6. Patient Education & Support:**\n- Provide written materials about:\n  - Lung cancer diagnosis\n  - Treatment options for Stage III disease\n  - What to expect with chemotherapy/immunotherapy/radiation\n  - Support resources\n- Smoking cessation counseling (though patient quit 8 years ago, reinforce importance)\n- Referral to:\n  - Social work for psychosocial support\n  - Nutrition services\n  - Palliative care for symptom management (NOT hospice - for quality of life optimization)\n\n**7. Symptomatic Management:**\n- Monitor weight, appetite\n- Address constitutional symptoms (night sweats, fatigue)\n- PRN anti-emetics if needed\n- Pain management as needed (none currently)\n**POST-PROCEDURE UPDATE (2.5 hours post-procedure):**\n\n**Chest X-Ray Results** (Reviewed by Dr. Victoria Chang):\n\nPA and Lateral Chest X-Ray performed at 1630 (2 hours post-procedure):\n\n**Findings:**\n- Lungs: No pneumothorax identified bilaterally\n- Left lower lobe: Mass visible (corresponds to known LLL lesion), unchanged from pre-procedure imaging\n- Pleural spaces: No effusion\n- Mediastinum: Widened (known mediastinal adenopathy), stable\n- Heart size: Normal\n- Bones: No acute abnormalities\n- Lines/tubes: None\n\n**Impression:**\n- No post-procedure pneumothorax\n- Known LLL mass unchanged\n- No other acute findings\n\n**Patient Status:**\n- Vital signs: BP 132/78, HR 72, RR 14, SpO2 97% on room air, Temp 36.8\u00b0C\n- Patient alert, comfortable, no complaints\n- Tolerating oral intake (had crackers and juice)\n- Ambulated to bathroom without difficulty\n- No respiratory distress, no chest pain\n- Voice slightly hoarse (expected from bronchoscopy)\n\n**Discharge Plan:**\n- Meets all discharge criteria\n- Patient lives 15 minutes from hospital with wife\n- Return precautions reviewed extensively with patient and wife\n- Written instructions provided\n- Emergency contact numbers provided\n- Follow-up appointments scheduled and confirmed\n- Patient verbalizes understanding of all instructions\n\n**Discharged to home at 1645 in stable condition.**\n**BILLING INFORMATION:**\n\n**CPT Codes:**\n- 31652 - Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) during bronchoscopic diagnostic or therapeutic intervention(s) (List separately in addition to code for primary procedure[s])\n- 31653 - Bronchoscopy with transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy, first target (concurrent with 31652)\n- 31654 - Bronchoscopy with radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS)\n- 31627 - Bronchoscopy with computer-assisted, image-guided navigation (electromagnetic navigation)\n- 31628 - Bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy\n- 31623 - Bronchoscopy with brushing or protected brushings\n- 31624 - Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage\n\n**Modifiers:** None required (all procedures performed at separate sites)\n\n**ICD-10 Codes:**\n- C34.32 - Malignant neoplasm of lower lobe, left bronchus or lung (PRELIMINARY - confirm with final pathology)\n- Z12.2 - Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of respiratory organs (if applicable)\n- F17.210 - Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated (history of smoking)\n**ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT:**\n\nI, Dr. Victoria Chang, MD, FCCP, Board Certified in Pulmonary Medicine and Interventional Pulmonary, was personally present throughout the entirety of this procedure.

Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.\n\nWe subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\n\nAt this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.\n\nPost-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer to ICU\n\u2022 Obtain post-procedure CXR\n\u2022 TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent\n\nLaura Bennett, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Screening LDCT revealed RUL nodule with spiculated margins. PET scan SUV 6.8. No mediastinal adenopathy. Presents for diagnostic evaluation and fiducial placement for potential SBRT.\n\n**Anesthesia:**\nModerate procedural sedation administered by anesthesia team (Dr. James Wilson). Versed 2mg, Fentanyl 75mcg, Propofol infusion titrated to effect. Total propofol 180mg. Patient maintained spontaneous respirations. O2 via nasal cannula 4L.\n\n**Monitoring:**\nContinuous pulse oximetry, telemetry, NIBP q3min. Independent observer (RN Kelly Martinez) dedicated to monitoring. No adverse events.\n\n**Procedure Narrative:**\n\nFollowing adequate sedation, Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope inserted transorally. Complete airway inspection:\n\nOropharynx/Larynx: WNL, good topicalization with 2% lidocaine spray\nVC: Mobile bilaterally\nTrachea: Midline, no stenosis or masses\nCarina: Acute angle, mobile\nRMS: Patent\nRUL/RML/RLL: All segments visualized, patent, no endobronchial abnormalities\nLMS: Patent\nLUL/Lingula/LLL: Patent, no lesions\n\nSuperDimension iLogic navigation system used. CT from 11/10/2024 loaded. 3D reconstruction showed target in RUL anterior segment, approximately 3cm from pleural surface.\n\n**Navigation Process:**\nAutomatic registration completed. 8 reference points confirmed. System accuracy indicator: 95%.\n\nLocatable guide (LG) with extended working channel navigated to target. Multiple airway bifurcations traversed under electromagnetic guidance. Final position: tool-to-target distance 7mm (acceptable range per software).\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20MHz) inserted through working channel:\n- Pattern: Concentric\n- Lesion characteristics: Hypoechoic, irregular borders\n- Size: 28mm x 31mm\n- Echo features suggest solid lesion\n\nProbe removed, guide sheath maintained in position.\n\n**Sampling via guide sheath:**\n1. Transbronchial forceps biopsies - 8 passes (specimens appeared adequate grossly, tan-white tissue fragments)\n2. Cytology brush - 4 passes\n3. Needle aspiration - 2 passes with 19G needle\n4. BAL - 60cc instilled, 28cc return\n\n**ROSE Results:**\nCytopathologist Dr. Susan Park present. Smears reviewed real-time.\nPass 1-3: Inadequate (mostly blood)\nPass 4-8: ADEQUATE. Clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei, prominent nucleoli. Morphology consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, likely adenocarcinoma. Cell block for immunohistochemistry pending.\n\n**Fiducial Placement:**\nGiven high suspicion for malignancy and potential for SBRT, fiducial marker placed for radiation planning.\n\nGold marker (0.8mm x 3mm, CIVCO) loaded into delivery catheter. Under fluoroscopic guidance, marker deployed in RUL anterior segmental bronchus, approximately 2cm from target lesion. Position confirmed with AP and lateral fluoroscopy. Marker stable, no migration observed.\n\n**Hemostasis:**\nMinimal bleeding from biopsy sites. Resolved with gentle suctioning and observation. No intervention required.\n\n**Completion:**\nAirways suctioned clear. Patient emerged from sedation appropriately. Extubated to room air. Post-procedure vitals stable. SpO2 97% RA.\n\n**Estimated Blood Loss:** <15mL\n\n**Specimens:**\n- TBBx x8 to histopathology (formalin)\n- Cytology specimens x4 (alcohol fixed)\n- Needle aspirate x2 (cell block)\n- BAL to microbiology (AFB, fungal, bacterial cx) and cytology\n\n**Complications:** None\n\n**Post-Procedure Orders:**\n1.

    "note_text": "PATIENT: James Wilson, 45-year-old Male\nMRN: 5894732\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Wilson is a 45-year-old male admitted 18 days ago with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patient remains ventilator-dependent with anticipated prolonged intubation. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to percutaneous tracheostomy were discussed with the patient's wife (patient sedated). Surrogate indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was obtained.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prolonged mechanical ventilation; ARDS\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Tracheostomy, Planned (Percutaneous, Bronchoscopic Assistance) (CPT 31600)\nATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor\nASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Amanda White\nRT: Christopher Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)\nMONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry\nINSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.\nWith bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nA syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.\nThe inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.\nThe Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.\nFinally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.\nThe endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S): None\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Wilson underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance. Procedure performed without complications. CXR post-procedure shows appropriate positioning without pneumothorax. Continue mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Tracheostomy care per protocol. Follow up with ICU team for ongoing management.",

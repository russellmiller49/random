    "note_text": "Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy in setting of testicular cancer s/p chemotherapy\nMedications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  \nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes. The Station 7 was 16.6 mm, the station 4R was 5.7mm and the station 11Rs was 8.9mm.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the station 7 Lymph node, followed by station 11Rs lymph node and then the 4R lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. A total of 5 needle passes were performed at each lymph node station. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. There was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. \n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy\n- Will await final pathology results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. There was partial dynamic obstruction of the trachea of unclear etiology.  The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.  Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes were seen in multiple stations in relatively symmetric pattern. Mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed by transbronchial needle aspiration with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node followed by the 4L lymph node and finally the 2R lymph node.  A total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station (station 2R 7 samples were collected). ROSE evaluation yielded multiple granulomas from the 11L, 4L and 2R stations and adequate lymphocytes from station 7. All samples were sent for routine cytology and two additional samples were taken for AFB and fungal culture from the station 2R. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood there and secretions there was some slow oozing seen in the bilateral lower lobes. 2ml of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine were instilled into each lower lobe and the bleeding stopped. Once we were confident that there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10ml\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results",

A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Just distal to the cricoid cartilage the suspicious 2L lymph node was identified Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with both the Olympus 19G and Olympus 22G needles with a total of 8 passes performed. Abundant lymphocytes were seen in rapid onsite pathological evaluation. Samples were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: min\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results",

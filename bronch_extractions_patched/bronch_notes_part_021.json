    "note_text": "Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy\nIndications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. \nMedications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  \nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of what appears to be a fused anterior segment of left upper lobe with lingula. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 4R. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet in AHLTA. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation did not identify malignancy. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe to the area of known nodule within the anterior segment and an eccentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 re-inserted into the airways. DECAMP research samples were then performed with brushing within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies in the RUL, RML and LUL. We ten observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\nComplications: \t\n-None \nEstimated Blood Loss:  10 cc.\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await biopsy results \n- Discharge home once criteria met.",

All left sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. The right upper and lower lobe airways were normal without endobronchial disease to the first segmental branch. Within the right middle lobe a shiny vascular obstructive endobronchial tumor was visualized within the lateral segment of the right middle lobe. The lesion was friable and bled easily with minimal manipulation. Subsequently 6 endobronchial needle biopsies of the nodule were performed. Due to bleeding from the lesion a total of 4ml of 10mg/10ml tranexamic acid was applied topically with subsequent resolution of bleeding.  The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4L, station 4R, station 7 and station 11Rs lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning at the N3 (4L) lymph nodes \uf0e07\uf0e04R\uf0e011Rs.

Onsite path evaluation did not identify malignancy. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and inserted the therapeutic T190 Olympus bronchoscope and advanced the scope into the right middle lobe where 5 forceps endobronchial biopsies were performed. Bleeding was moderate and required intermittent mechanical tamponade with the tip of the bronchoscope. After biopsies were completed we monitored for evidence of active bleeding and none was seen.

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the station 4R lymph node, followed by the station 7 lymph node and finally the 4L lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as benign lymphoid tissue in all sampled nodes. All samples were sent for routine cytology and flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. Using fluoroscopy transbronchial forceps lung biopsies were performed in both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Finally BAL was performed with 120cc instillation and 40cc return. Prior to removing the bronchoscope an airway examination was performed and no evidence of active bleeding was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. \n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage \n- Will await final pathology and culture results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we were able to advance the 45 degree edge catheter into the anterior segment on the right upper lobe and navigated to within 1cm of the lesion. The navigational probe was then removed and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded a concentric view affirming the location.  Needle biopsies were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE showed abundant lymphocytes and inflammatory cells but no obvious malignancy. Tissue biopsies were then performed using forceps under fluoroscopic visualization. After samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the diagnostic bronchoscope was re-inserted into the airway. Subsequent inspection did not show evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed from the airway. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful electromagnetic navigation and biopsy of right upper lobe nodule. \n- Await path and flow results",

The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of what appears to be a fused anterior segment of left upper lobe with lingula. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 Therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway.  A sheath catheter was advanced through the working channel into the segment of suspicion. A radial US was advanced through the sheath and concentric view of lesion was seen. Using fluoroscopy, transbronchial needle biopsies were performed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy. We then performed 6 bronchoscopic lung biopsies in the same area under fluoroscopic visualization with forceps.   \nWe then removed the therapeutic scope and re0inserted the Q190 videoscope. After cleaning of blood and debris no active bleeding and none was identified. Fluoroscopy was then used to scan for evidence of pneumothorax which was not seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\n\nComplications: \t\n-None \nEstimated Blood Loss:  5 cc\nRecommendations:\n- post-procedure CXR\n- Await biopsy results \n- Discharge home once criteria met.",

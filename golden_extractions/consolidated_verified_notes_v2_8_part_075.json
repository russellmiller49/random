Decision made for tunneled pleural catheter for home drainage.\n\nINFORMED CONSENT: Procedure risks, benefits, and alternatives discussed. Patient understands and consents.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nWith the patient in left lateral decubitus position, timeout performed confirming right side. The right lateral chest wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound used to identify optimal insertion site in the 5th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Pocket of fluid confirmed, pleural sliding absent confirming adhesions.\n\nLocal anesthesia with 1% lidocaine infiltrated along proposed tract and subcutaneous tunnel path. A 3cm incision was made at the insertion site. Using the tunneling trocar, a 10cm subcutaneous tunnel was created anteriorly ending approximately 5cm from the axilla. The PleurX catheter was drawn through the tunnel with the polyester cuff positioned 2cm from the exit site.\n\nThe pleural space was entered using Seldinger technique under real-time ultrasound guidance. The 15.5Fr PleurX catheter was advanced over the guidewire and positioned in the posterior pleural space. Good flow confirmed with drainage of 1,200mL of bloody, viscous fluid which was sent for cytology, cell count, and chemistry.\n\nThe catheter was secured with 2-0 silk suture at the exit site. Sterile dressing applied. Chest X-ray obtained showing catheter in good position with improved aeration of right lung base, no pneumothorax.\n\nSPECIMENS: Pleural fluid to cytology, cell count, LDH, protein, glucose\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<10mL)\n\nDISPOSITION: Discharge home with PleurX drainage supplies and home health nursing arranged for drainage teaching and supervision.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: Return to clinic in 1 week for wound check and drainage log review.\n\nAmanda Rodriguez, MD, FCCP\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Prior TIPS revision unsuccessful. Requiring twice-weekly thoracenteses with significant symptom burden. Not a liver transplant candidate.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hepatic hydrothorax\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\n\nPROCEDURE: Tunneled indwelling pleural catheter placement, right hemithorax\n\nANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 2mg IV, Fentanyl 75mcg IV) with local anesthesia (1% lidocaine with epinephrine)\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\nPatient positioned in left lateral decubitus. Standard surgical timeout completed confirming right side, procedure, and patient identity. Pre-procedure ultrasound demonstrated large right pleural effusion with no loculations. Optimal entry point identified at 6th intercostal space, posterior axillary line.\n\nThe skin was prepped with chlorhexidine and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered along the proposed insertion tract and subcutaneous tunnel. A 15mm skin incision was made at the insertion point.\n\nUsing the Rocket Medical tunneling system, a 12cm subcutaneous tunnel was created from the insertion site anteriorly toward the anterior axillary line. The Rocket IPC was threaded through the tunnel with the Dacron cuff positioned approximately 2cm from the exit site to promote tissue ingrowth.\n\nThe pleural space was accessed using modified Seldinger technique. Real-time ultrasound confirmed the guidewire position in the pleural space. The dilator and peel-away sheath were introduced, and the 15.5Fr Rocket catheter was advanced into the pleural space. The position was confirmed with aspiration of clear, straw-colored fluid.\n\n1,800mL of transudative-appearing fluid was drained. Pleural fluid samples sent for cell count, chemistry, culture, and cytology. The catheter was secured with 2-0 Prolene sutures. Exit site dressed with sterile gauze and Tegaderm.\n\nPost-procedure CXR showed catheter tip in dependent right hemithorax, significant improvement in effusion, no pneumothorax.\n\nFINDINGS:\n- Large free-flowing right pleural effusion\n- Transudative appearing fluid\n- No loculations or septations\n- Catheter positioned in posterior dependent space\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: <5mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Admitted for overnight observation given hepatic encephalopathy risk with large volume drainage. Home health arranged for daily drainage (max 1000mL/day).\n\nFOLLOW-UP: Interventional pulmonology clinic in 2 weeks.\n\nElectronically signed by:\nJames Park, MD\nLisa Tran, MD (Fellow)",

Recurrent bilateral pleural effusions\n2. New York Heart Association Class IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 15%)\n3. Not candidate for mechanical circulatory support or transplant\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\n\nPROCEDURE: Left-sided tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (PleurX) placement\n\nINDICATION: This 84-year-old female with end-stage heart failure has required hospitalization 6 times in the past 3 months for symptomatic bilateral pleural effusions despite maximum medical therapy. After multidisciplinary discussion including heart failure, palliative care, and IP, decision was made for left-sided IPC given larger effusion on left. Patient and family understand palliative intent.\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia only (2% lidocaine) - patient unable to tolerate any sedation given severity of cardiac dysfunction.\n\nPROCEDURE:\nPatient positioned semi-recumbent at 45 degrees (unable to lay flat due to orthopnea). Timeout completed. Ultrasound identified large left pleural effusion. Skin marked at 6th intercostal space, anterior axillary line.\n\nSkin prepped with ChloraPrep. Local anesthesia infiltrated liberally along proposed tract. 3cm skin incision made. Tunneling device used to create 8cm subcutaneous tunnel anteriorly. PleurX 15.5Fr catheter threaded through tunnel.\n\nPleural space entered using Seldinger technique under ultrasound guidance. Catheter advanced without difficulty. Initial drainage of 800mL clear yellow fluid - drainage stopped per institutional protocol for heart failure patients (max 500-1000mL to avoid re-expansion issues and volume shifts).\n\nCatheter secured with suture. Dry sterile dressing applied. Post-procedure portable CXR confirms good catheter position, no pneumothorax.\n\nFluid sent for: Cell count, chemistry, NT-proBNP\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None. Patient tolerated procedure well with no hemodynamic changes.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Overnight telemetry monitoring\n2. Home health for IPC drainage teaching\n3.

Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Balloon dilation of tracheal stenosis\n3. Biodegradable tracheal stent placement (BD-Stent, Merit Endotek)\n\nINDICATION: 46-year-old male with history of prolonged intubation (28 days) for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 in 2021. Developed tracheal stenosis requiring multiple dilations. Has failed 3 prior balloon dilations with recurrence within 4-6 weeks. After discussion of options including T-tube, surgical resection, and biodegradable stent, patient elected for biodegradable stent trial given relatively young age and desire to avoid permanent stent or surgery.\n\nANESTHESIA: Total intravenous anesthesia (propofol/remifentanil)\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nUnder TIVA, rigid bronchoscopy performed using 12mm Storz ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Airway anatomy:\n- Subglottic region: Normal\n- Tracheal stenosis: Located 2.5cm below vocal cords, approximately 8mm thick web-like stenosis narrowing the lumen to 5mm (Grade III, Myer-Cotton)\n- Distal trachea and bilateral mainstem: Normal\n\nBalloon dilation performed using 15mm x 40mm CRE balloon (Boston Scientific). Balloon inflated to 8 ATM x 60 seconds x 3 inflations with radial fracturing of the stenosis observed. Post-dilation diameter approximately 12mm.\n\nMerit Endotek BD-Stent (18mm diameter x 30mm length, polydioxanone-based) selected based on tracheal measurements. Stent delivery system advanced through the rigid bronchoscope and deployed under direct visualization with the proximal and distal markers positioned 1cm beyond the stenosis margins. Stent expanded fully to approximately 16mm. Confirmation of good apposition to tracheal wall.\n\nPost-procedure bronchoscopy confirmed patent airway through the stent with no evidence of stent migration. Mucosa intact with minimal bleeding from dilation site.\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: <5mL\n\nDISPOSITION: PACU recovery, discharge home same day with post-procedure instructions. No activity restrictions. Soft diet x 24 hours.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n- Bronchoscopy in 8 weeks for stent assessment\n- BD-Stent expected to degrade over 4-6 months\n- CT airway in 3 months\n\nDr. Rachel Kim, MD\nDr. Ahmed Hassan, MD",

Rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal\n2. Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC\n\nINDICATION: 69-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was placed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius patent\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent\n\nFinal inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS: None (stent sent to pathology for documentation)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: 15mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Same day discharge anticipated. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks to assess granulation tissue recurrence.\n\nDr. David Chen, MD\nDr. Katherine Wong, MD",

Clinical presentation consistent with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis, Stage II\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same (pending pathology)\n\nPROCEDURE:\n1. Flexible bronchoscopy\n2. Bronchoalveolar lavage\n3. Fluoroscopic-guided transbronchial lung biopsy, right upper lobe\n\nSEDATION: Moderate sedation (Versed 3mg, Fentanyl 75mcg) with topical lidocaine\n\nPROCEDURE NOTE:\nPatient was sedated and bronchoscope introduced via oral route. Airway examination revealed normal vocal cords, patent trachea, and normal-appearing carina. All visible airways were free of endobronchial abnormalities. Mucosa appeared normal throughout.\n\nBAL was performed in the right middle lobe using 150mL sterile saline (3 x 50mL). Approximately 75mL of slightly turbid fluid was recovered and sent for cell count, differential, CD4/CD8 ratio, cultures, and cytology.\n\nFor transbronchial biopsies, the bronchoscope was advanced into the right upper lobe. Using biplanar fluoroscopy (AP and lateral views), the biopsy forceps (standard cup forceps) were advanced into the RUL anterior segment (RB3) and positioned approximately 2cm from the pleural surface. 8 biopsies were obtained from the right upper lobe, targeting areas of perilymphatic nodularity.\n\nEach specimen was placed in formalin and examined visually - multiple fragments appeared adequate in size. Minimal bleeding occurred, controlled with wedge technique. Repeat fluoroscopy at end of procedure showed no pneumothorax.\n\nFLUOROSCOPY DATA:\n- Total fluoro time: 1.8 min\n- DAP: 24 mGy\u00b7cm\u00b2\n\nSPECIMENS:\n1. BAL - Cell count/diff, CD4/CD8 ratio, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures, PCP DFA, cytology\n2. TBLB RUL x 8 - Surgical pathology with request for special stains (GMS, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5mL\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE: Patient recovered well. CXR 2 hours post-procedure showed no pneumothorax. Patient discharged home in stable condition.\n\nIMPRESSION: Airways grossly normal. TBLB and BAL obtained for suspected sarcoidosis workup. Await pathology for non-caseating granulomas and BAL lymphocytosis/elevated CD4:CD8 ratio to confirm diagnosis.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: Return to sarcoidosis clinic in 2 weeks for results.\n\nErin McCarthy, MD\nAlex Rivera, MD",

CT chest showed bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud opacities. Sputum cultures pending. Bronchoscopy for airway inspection and clearance of blood/secretions.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemoptysis, likely infectious etiology vs bronchiectasis\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions; no endobronchial lesion or active bleeding source identified\n\nPROCEDURE: Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning\n\nSEDATION: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 50mcg IV)\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nThe patient was sedated and the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-P190) was introduced via the oropharynx. The vocal cords appeared normal without lesions or edema. The trachea was patent with normal mucosa. Carina was sharp.\n\nAIRWAY FINDINGS:\n- Right mainstem: Patent. Old blood coating the mucosa.\n- Right upper lobe: Multiple segments with thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood. Significant bronchiectatic changes. No endobronchial lesions. No active bleeding visualized.\n- Bronchus intermedius: Patent with mild inflammation\n- Right middle lobe: Mucopurulent secretions, no masses\n- Right lower lobe: Bronchiectatic changes, thick secretions\n- Left mainstem: Patent, old blood noted\n- Left upper lobe: Similar bronchiectatic changes with mucopurulent secretions. No tumor or active bleeding.\n- Lingula: Mild secretions\n- Left lower lobe: Bronchiectasis, mucopurulent secretions, no source of bleeding identified\n\nTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:\nExtensive suctioning performed throughout all visualized airways. Large quantities of thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood were cleared from bilateral bronchi. No single bleeding source could be identified - the hemoptysis appears to be diffuse from inflamed bronchiectatic airways.\n\nNo biopsy was performed as no discrete lesion identified. No BAL performed as secretions already sent from suctioning.\n\nSPECIMENS: \n- Bronchial aspirate/secretions: Bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB culture, cytology\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None. No active bleeding during or after procedure.\n\nEBL: Trace\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE: Patient tolerated well. No respiratory distress. CXR unchanged from pre-procedure.\n\nIMPRESSION & PLAN:\n1. Diffuse bilateral bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions - no discrete bleeding source identified\n2. Hemoptysis likely from diffuse bronchiectatic mucosal inflammation with superimposed infection\n3. No endobronchial malignancy identified\n4. Continue empiric antibiotics pending cultures\n5. Pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy\n6. Follow-up in 2 weeks; consider repeat CT if hemoptysis persists\n\nDr. Jennifer Liu, MD\nPulmonary/Critical Care",

Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)\n2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)\n3. VATS lysis of adhesions\n4. VATS pleural biopsy\n5. Decortication (partial)\n6. Chest tube placement\n\nINDICATION: 64-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest revealed large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 showed exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\n\nMEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):\nPatient positioned in left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.\n\nA 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.\n\nDECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.\n\nVATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):\nThe incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was identified. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.\n\nFindings:\n- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout\n- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung\n- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)\n- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained\n\nMultiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.\n\nA 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase\n- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively. Conversion was planned contingency.\n\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to SICU for overnight monitoring. Chest tube to suction.\n\nPOST-OPERATIVE PLAN:\n1. Monitor chest tube output\n2. CXR in AM\n3. Await pathology - concern for malignant mesothelioma or chronic fibrinous pleuritis\n4. If lung remains trapped, may require chronic indwelling pleural catheter\n\nDr. Mark Anderson, MD - Interventional Pulmonology\nDr. Sarah Kim, MD - Thoracic Surgery",

CT chest shows persistent right apical pneumothorax with bronchial stump intact but suspected peripheral alveolar-pleural fistula in the remaining RML/RLL. Given poor surgical candidacy for re-thoracotomy (COPD, recent surgery, poor nutritional status), endobronchial valve placement was planned for non-surgical management of the air leak.\n\nNOTE: This is NOT a BLVR procedure for emphysema/lung volume reduction. The indication is therapeutic air leak closure in the setting of BPF.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia (TIVA) with single-lumen ETT\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\nPatient intubated and positioned supine. Flexible bronchoscopy performed. Airway inspection revealed:\n- Trachea: Normal\n- Right bronchial stump: Healing well, no gross leak\n- Right bronchus intermedius: Patent\n- Right middle lobe: Patent, normal appearance\n- Right lower lobe: Segmental bronchi appeared inflamed but patent\n- Left lung: Normal\n\nBalloon occlusion testing was performed to identify the leaking segment. Sequential balloon occlusion of right lower lobe segments revealed:\n- RB6 (superior segment): Partial reduction in air leak\n- RB7-10 (basal segments): Further reduction with RB9 occlusion\n- Combined RB6 + RB9 occlusion: Complete cessation of air leak\n\nBased on balloon occlusion testing, decision was made to place endobronchial valves in RB6 and RB9.\n\nValve placement:\n1. RB6 (superior segment): Zephyr 4.0mm EBV deployed. Good fit, no air flow around valve.\n2. RB9 (lateral basal segment): Zephyr 4.0-LP EBV deployed. Good fit.\n\nPost-valve bronchoscopy confirmed valves in good position. Patient's chest tube placed to water seal at end of procedure.\n\nImmediate post-procedure assessment showed COMPLETE CESSATION of air leak on the chest tube drainage system.\n\nDEVICES:\n- Zephyr EBV 4.0mm x 1 (RB6)\n- Zephyr EBV 4.0-LP x 1 (RB9)\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: Minimal\n\nDISPOSITION: Return to thoracic surgery floor. Chest tube to water seal. If no air leak for 48 hours, will remove chest tube.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: Will monitor for valve expectoration. Repeat bronchoscopy in 6-8 weeks for potential valve removal if air leak remains resolved. Valves may be permanent if necessary.\n\nDr. Priya Patel, MD\nDr. Kevin Nguyen, MD",

Referred for EBUS-TBNA staging prior to planned surgical resection if N2/N3 negative.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right upper lobe lung mass concerning for primary lung malignancy; mediastinal lymphadenopathy for staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same; mediastinal lymph nodes sampled - ROSE benign at all stations\n\nPROCEDURE: Linear EBUS bronchoscopy with transbronchial needle aspiration of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (5 stations)\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with LMA\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\nThe EBUS bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was introduced through the LMA. Systematic mediastinal staging was performed.\n\nSTATION-BY-STATION SAMPLING:\n\nStation 7 (Subcarinal):\n- Size: 22mm short axis, oval, heterogeneous, no CHS\n- Elastography: Score 4 (suspicious)\n- Sampling: 22G FNA needle, 4 passes\n- ROSE: Abundant lymphocytes, no malignant cells, ADEQUATE - BENIGN\n\nStation 4R (Right lower paratracheal):\n- Size: 18mm short axis, round, heterogeneous\n- Elastography: Score 3 (indeterminate)\n- Sampling: 22G FNA needle, 4 passes  \n- ROSE: Lymphocytes with scattered histiocytes, no malignant cells, ADEQUATE - BENIGN\n\nStation 4L (Left lower paratracheal):\n- Size: 12mm short axis, oval, homogeneous, CHS present\n- Elastography: Score 2 (benign-appearing)\n- Sampling: 22G FNA needle, 3 passes\n- ROSE: Reactive lymphocytes, ADEQUATE - BENIGN\n\nStation 10R (Right hilar):\n- Size: 14mm short axis\n- Sampling: 22G FNA needle, 3 passes\n- ROSE: Lymphocytes and bronchial cells, ADEQUATE - BENIGN\n\nStation 11R (Right interlobar):\n- Size: 11mm short axis\n- Sampling: 22G FNA needle, 3 passes\n- ROSE: Lymphocytes, ADEQUATE - BENIGN\n\nAll samples sent for cell block and final cytopathology.\n\nNo complications. Airways examined and appeared normal. No endobronchial lesion at RUL orifice.\n\nROSE SUMMARY (Dr. Taylor):\n\"5 stations sampled with adequate lymphocyte material at all stations. No malignant cells identified at any station. Recommend final pathology confirmation. If staging remains N0 on final path, patient may proceed with planned surgical resection. If clinical suspicion remains high despite negative EBUS, recommend surgical staging (mediastinoscopy) given substantial adenopathy and risk of sampling error.\"\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Station 7: Cytology, cell block\n- Station 4R: Cytology, cell block\n- Station 4L: Cytology, cell block\n- Station 10R: Cytology, cell block\n- Station 11R: Cytology, cell block\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: <5mL\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. EBUS-TBNA of 5 mediastinal/hilar stations performed for lung cancer staging\n2. ROSE negative for malignancy at all stations\n3. Pending final cytopathology confirmation\n\nPLAN:\n1. Await final pathology (3-5 days)\n2. Discussed with patient: If final pathology benign at all stations, will recommend surgical mediastinoscopy given size of station 7 and 4R nodes and high suspicion for malignancy based on primary lesion PET characteristics\n3. Thoracic surgery consultation placed for mediastinoscopy\n4. If mediastinoscopy also negative, patient will proceed with lobectomy + lymph node dissection\n\nDr. Robert Chen, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology",

Patient reports increased dyspnea and has not been able to drain at home due to suspected catheter occlusion.\n\nPROCEDURE: Under sterile technique, the PleurX catheter was accessed. Initial aspiration revealed thick loculated fluid. The catheter was flushed with 10mL saline with return of cloudy fluid. A total of 850mL of serosanguinous fluid was drained. tPA 4mg/40mL NS was instilled per protocol for suspected fibrinous occlusion. Patient to clamp for 2 hours then attempt drainage.\n\nSPECIMENS: Pleural fluid to cytology, culture\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nPLAN: Home health to continue daily drainage. Return if unable to drain.

Subsequently, the Left Upper Lobe was cannulated, and an additional ten coils were deployed. \nIMPRESSION: Successful deployment of 20 endobronchial coils total.

Based on CT sizing, a 5.5mm valve was selected for LB6 and a 4.0mm valve for the basilar trunk. The LB6 valve required initial repositioning to ensure an airtight seal. Final inspection confirmed total lobar isolation.\nOUTCOME: Successful LLL BLVR. Patient stable.",

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the RUL Carina (RC1), Bronchus Intermedius, Left Carina (LC2), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Left Mainstem, RML Carina (RC2), Carina from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t14\t283\t13\t80\t6\t19\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 3.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apicoposterior Segment of LUL (LB1+2). Target lesion is approximately 24mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 0.7cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 7 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 6 seconds was used. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nFiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.\n\nTransbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Apicoposterior Segment of LUL (LB1+2). Instilled 60cc of NS, suction returned with 22cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Lymphocytes and benign cells, adequate for evaluation\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nWilliams, MD",

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Carina, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), RML Carina (RC2) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t12\t331\t15\t80\t6\t24\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 3.4mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apicoposterior Segment of LUL (LB1+2). Target lesion is approximately 31mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.7cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Concentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock.

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, Left Carina (LC2), RUL Carina (RC1) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t12\t295\t12\t80\t5\t22\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Lingula (LB4). Target lesion is approximately 11mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.7cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nPark, MD",

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Left Mainstem, Right Mainstem, Carina, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), RML Carina (RC2), Trachea (Distal 1/3) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t12\t319\t14\t80\t5\t24\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 3.8mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Target lesion is approximately 33mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 2.0cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Concentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 7 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nFiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.\n\nTransbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Lymphocytes and benign cells, adequate for evaluation\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nAnderson, MD",

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Left Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), Bronchus Intermedius, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), RML Carina (RC2), Carina, Right Mainstem, Trachea (Distal 1/3) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t11\t370\t16\t100\t6\t24\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.4mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior-Basal Segment of RLL (RB8). Target lesion is approximately 33mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.1cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 7 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nTransbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable.

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Bronchus Intermedius, RUL Carina (RC1) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t13\t298\t8\t80\t5\t17\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Lateral-Basal Segment of LLL (LB9). Target lesion is approximately 9mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.8cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 7 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nFiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.\n\nTransbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Lateral-Basal Segment of LLL (LB9). Instilled 60cc of NS, suction returned with 23cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Malignant cells identified, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nDavis, MD",

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the RUL Carina (RC1), Left Carina (LC2), Carina, Bronchus Intermedius, RML Carina (RC2), Left Mainstem, Right Mainstem, Trachea (Distal 1/3) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t10\t371\t16\t100\t8\t19\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 1.7mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-Basal Segment of RLL (RB10). Target lesion is approximately 30mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 6 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nROSE Result: Malignant cells identified, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nLee, MD",

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Left Mainstem, Left Carina (LC2), Carina, Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t13\t399\t14\t80\t5\t24\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.8mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Target lesion is approximately 25mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.2cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 7 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 7 seconds was used. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Instilled 80cc of NS, suction returned with 27cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nMartinez, MD",

    "note_text": "Pt: Moore, Stephanie || MRN: 9533561 || DOB: 10/27/1972\nDate: 08/11/2025 || Location: Stanford Health Care, Stanford, CA\nAttending: Dr. Christopher Brown\nFellow: Dr. Kevin Patel (PGY-5)\n\nIndication: Solitary pulmonary nodule\nTarget: 25mm nodule in RML\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n\nThe endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Bronchus Intermedius, RML Carina (RC2), Left Mainstem, Left Carina (LC2), RUL Carina (RC1), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t14\t326\t11\t100\t6\t22\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.6mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Target lesion is approximately 25mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.1cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.\n\nThe robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 7 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Instilled 40cc of NS, suction returned with 19cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Granulomatous inflammation\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nBrown, MD",

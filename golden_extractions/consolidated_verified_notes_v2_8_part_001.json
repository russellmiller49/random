    "note_text": "PATIENT: Patricia Johnson, 74-year-old Female\nMRN: 1034928\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Johnson is a 74-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with recurrent symptomatic right-sided malignant pleural effusion despite two recent therapeutic thoracenteses. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to tunneled pleural catheter placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion, right\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Catheter Placement (CPT 32550)\nATTENDING: Dr. Rachel Green\nASSISTANT: Dr. Paul Anderson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jennifer Martinez\nRT: David Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1%\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, blood pressure\nINSTRUMENT: CareFusion PleurX catheter system, ultrasound machine\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated\nCHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)\n\nHemithorax: Right\nPleural Effusion Volume: Large\nEchogenicity: Anechoic\nLoculations: None\nDiaphragmatic Motion: Diminished\nLung sliding before procedure: Present\nLung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)\nPleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized\n\nThe right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.\nANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract\nEntry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space\nLocation: Mid-axillary line\nProcedure Steps:\n\nA finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.\nSterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).\n\nExit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line\nInitial Drainage:\nThe PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.\n\nFluid Removed: 1200 mL\nAppearance: Serous, straw-colored\n\nPleural Pressures Measured:\n\nOpening: -8 cmH\u2082O\n500ml: -10 cmH\u2082O\n1000ml: -15 cmH\u2082O\n1200ml: -18 cmH\u2082O (stopped due to chest discomfort)\n\nDrainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nPost-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Johnson underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion. Procedure completed without complications. Patient and family educated on catheter care and home drainage protocol. Drainage every other day initially, adjusting based on output. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Home health nursing arranged for first drainage. Patient given written discharge instructions and emergency contact information.",

PET shows SUV 3.2. Nodule location is peripheral in the lateral basal segment. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to robotic navigational bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy using Intuitive Ion System (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Biopsy (CPT 31628), Transbronchial Brushing (CPT 31623)\nATTENDING: Dr. Amanda Roberts\nASSISTANT: Dr. Jason Kim, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Laura Martinez\nRT: Thomas Wilson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Susan Park\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Intuitive Ion Robotic Platform, radial EBUS probe, biopsy forceps, cytology brush\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\nVentilation Parameters:\n\nMode: Volume Control\nRR: 12\nTV: 500mL\nPEEP: 5 cmH\u2082O\nFiO\u2082: 40%\nFlow Rate: 50 L/min\nPmean: 14 cmH\u2082O\n\nNavigation Planning:\nCT Chest scan from 9/28/2024 was placed on the separate planning station (Synapse Lung) to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target nodule in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe (LB9). The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform.\nTarget lesion characteristics:\n\nLocation: LLL, lateral basal segment (LB9)\nSize: 1.8cm\nDistance from pleura: 1.2cm\nBronchus sign: Present\n\nIon Registration - Complete:\nRegistration to the pre-procedure CT was completed using automatic methods. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at:\n\nMain carina\nLeft main carina\nLLL segmental carinas\nTertiary bifurcations in LB9\n\nMean fiducial error: 3.8mm\nGlobal alignment quality: Excellent\nNo registration drift observed during the case\nA confidence sweep confirmed stable targeting throughout the planned trajectory with virtual-to-live alignment within acceptable parameters.\nNavigation:\nThe Ion catheter was advanced under navigational guidance through the left mainstem bronchus, into the LLL, and subsequently into the LB9 segment. The robotic system provided real-time feedback with shape sensing technology.\nTarget reached notification appeared when catheter tip was 0.6cm from the planned target center.\nRadial EBUS Confirmation:\nRadial EBUS probe (1.4mm) was passed through the Ion extended working channel to confirm lesion location. The following features were noted:\n\nPattern: Concentric\nEchogenicity: Heterogeneous\nLesion size by REBUS: 19mm\nDistance to pleura: 11mm\nVessel proximity: No large vessels within 5mm\n\nCone-Beam CT Verification:\nMobile C-arm CBCT spin was performed with the Ion catheter in position. Three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed:\n\nCatheter tip within lesion margins\nDistance from lesion center: 4mm\nTrajectory angle: Optimal for sampling\nNo pleural transgression\n\nSampling:\nWith confirmed tool-in-lesion position:\n\nTransbronchial Biopsy: Forceps biopsies obtained through Ion extended working channel. Total 6 samples collected with visible tissue in each specimen.\nBronchial Brushings: Cytology brush advanced to lesion site. Total 2 brush samples obtained.\nAspiration: Catheter aspiration performed for cytology.\n\nAll samples appeared adequate with visible tissue/cellular material. No ROSE available.\nPost-Sampling Inspection:\nThe Ion catheter was withdrawn. Final bronchoscopic inspection showed:\n\nNo active bleeding from biopsy site\nPatent LLL airways\nNo complications identified\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Roberts, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nLLL nodule forceps biopsies x6 (histology, molecular if malignant)\nBronchial brushings x2 (cytology)\nCatheter aspiration (cytology)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Chang underwent successful robotic navigational bronchoscopy with sampling of LLL nodule. Procedure completed without complications. Post-procedure CXR shows no pneumothorax. Patient discharged home same day with instructions to follow up in 1 week for pathology results. If benign, will need CT follow-up in 3-6 months per Fleischner criteria. If malignant, will be discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board for treatment planning.",

    "note_text": "Patient: Harold Stevens | Age: 66 | Sex: M | MRN: 1256170\nDate: October 8, 2024\nAttending: Dr. Nicole Turner\nClinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.\nWe discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.\nProcedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement\nHow it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.\nThrough the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.\nMultiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.\nAfter biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.\nPathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry\nPatient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.\nFollow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.",

After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.\nInitial Bronchoscopic Survey:\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:\n\nUpper airways: Normal\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\nRight bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions\nLeft bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus\n\nTumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):\n\nLocation: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall\nSize: 1.8cm (longitudinal) \u00d7 0.9cm (circumferential extent)\nMorphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion\nColor: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization\nSurface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance\nObstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing\nDistal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:\nLaser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.\nTreatment Parameters:\n\nWavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)\nPower output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length\nDiffuser length: 2.5 cm\nTotal power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)\nLight dose (fluence): 200 J/cm\u00b2 of diffuser surface\nTreatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)\nCalculation: 200 J/cm\u00b2 \u00f7 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds\n\nLight was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:\n\nLaser energy meter verified consistent power output\nNo visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)\nNo charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)\nPatient hemodynamically stable throughout\nNo arrhythmias or desaturations\n\nPost-Treatment Assessment:\nImmediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.\nLight Precautions Review:\nPost-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:\n\nStrict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum\nWear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors\nGradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing\nEmergency contact information provided\nWritten instructions given\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient Michael Torres 59M MRN 1589403, October 15 2024, Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.",

    "note_text": "Bronchoscopy Note\nPatient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female\nDate: October 17, 2024\nDoc: Dr. Steven Park\nMRN: 1690514\nSo Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.\nBrought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).\nSo here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.\nAfter cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.\nThe distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.\nDid a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.\nRecommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.\nOverall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",

Initial drainage was 1400mL, then decreased to <100mL/day for the past 48 hours. CXR today shows good lung expansion with only minimal residual pleural fluid. No air leak present. Patient is appropriate candidate for pleurodesis.\nConsent: Obtained from patient. Risks discussed include chest pain/discomfort, fever, respiratory distress (rare), failure of pleurodesis requiring repeat procedure.\nPremedication:\n\nMorphine 4mg IV given 30 minutes prior\nAcetaminophen 1000mg PO given 1 hour prior\nOndansetron 4mg IV given for nausea prophylaxis\n\n\nPROCEDURE STEPS:\nStep 1 - Verification (Time: 14:00)\n\nVerified chest tube patency by flushing with 10mL sterile saline\nConfirmed no air leak on water seal\nReviewed most recent CXR with radiologist - confirmed adequate lung expansion\n\nStep 2 - Lidocaine Administration (Time: 14:05)\n\nDrew up 20mL of 1% lidocaine (200mg total)\nAdministered through chest tube slowly over 2 minutes\nClamped tube for 5 minutes to allow lidocaine to distribute\nReleased clamp, allowed to drain\n\nStep 3 - Talc Slurry Preparation (Time: 14:15)\n\nPrepared sterile talc slurry: 4 grams talc powder in 50mL normal saline\nMixed thoroughly in sterile cup until uniform suspension achieved\nDrew up into 60mL catheter tip syringe\n\nStep 4 - Talc Administration (Time: 14:20)\n\nSlowly instilled talc slurry through chest tube over 5 minutes\nFollowed with 20mL normal saline flush to ensure complete delivery\nImmediately clamped chest tube\n\nStep 5 - Position Changes (Time: 14:25 - 15:25)\nPatient rotated through positions every 15 minutes to distribute talc:\n\nPosition 1 (14:25): Supine - 15 minutes\nPosition 2 (14:40): Right lateral decubitus - 15 minutes\nPosition 3 (14:55): Prone (as tolerated) - 10 minutes\nPosition 4 (15:05): Left lateral decubitus - 15 minutes\nPosition 5 (15:20): Return to supine - 5 minutes\n\nTotal dwell time: 60 minutes\nStep 6 - Resumption of Drainage (Time: 15:25)\n\nReleased clamp on chest tube\nConnected back to suction at -20 cmH2O\nImmediate return of approximately 30mL serosanguineous fluid\n\n\nPATIENT TOLERANCE:\nDuring procedure:\n\nVital signs stable throughout\nComplained of moderate chest discomfort (5/10) during position changes\nReceived additional morphine 2mg IV at 14:50\nNo respiratory distress\nOxygen saturation maintained >94% on 2L NC\n\nPost-procedure (2 hours observation):\n\nChest discomfort decreased to 3/10\nNo fever (temp 37.2\u00b0C)\nNo dyspnea\nChest tube draining serosanguineous fluid, approximately 50mL total since unclamping\n\nSPECIMENS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n\nContinue chest tube to suction -20 cmH2O\nMonitor drainage every 4 hours\nPain control: Morphine 2-4mg IV q4h PRN, acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h scheduled\nChest X-ray in AM\nIf drainage <150mL over next 24 hours AND CXR shows no reaccumulation, consider chest tube removal in 48-72 hours\n\nASSESSMENT: Chemical pleurodesis with talc slurry via chest tube completed successfully without complications. Patient tolerated procedure reasonably well with adequate pain control. Will monitor for pleurodesis efficacy over next several days.\nFollow-up Plan:\n\nDaily CXR while chest tube in place\nRemove chest tube when drainage criteria met (typically 2-3 days)\nFollow-up CXR 1 week after chest tube removal\nIf recurrent effusion develops, may consider PleurX catheter placement",

Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.\nRUSHED TO BEDSIDE\nArrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.\nSCOPE FINDINGS:\nETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.\nRIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal\nLEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.\nINITIAL MEASURES:\n\nIced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope\nSome temporary improvement but bleeding continues\nEpi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect\nTranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction\n\nBALLOON TAMPONADE:\nBlood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.\nKept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.\nSecond deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.\nFINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:\nAfter tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.\nSPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)\nPLAN:\n\nICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)\nKeep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning\nReverse any coagulopathy (check labs)\nCTA chest to identify bleeding vessel\nIR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am\nI'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR\nIf rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation\n\nUPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently. IR taking to angio suite. Will follow up later this AM.",

Over a guidewire a 14 x 40 mm straight silicone tracheal stent was deployed across the stenosis and positioned ~2 cm above the carina. Post-deployment the airway lumen was widely patent with about 20% residual narrowing.\nComplications: Mild oozing controlled with topical epinephrine and iced saline; no hypoxia or pneumothorax.\nDisposition: Patient remained intubated and was transported to the ICU in stable condition for overnight airway observation.",

A guidewire was passed into the right lower lobe and the ETT exchanged to a rigid bronchoscope. Serial balloon dilations to 12 mm were performed. A 12 x 40 mm self-expanding metallic stent was deployed in the right mainstem under fluoroscopic and bronchoscopic visualization with good expansion and coverage of the lesion. Residual narrowing estimated at 20%.\nComplications: Mild bleeding controlled with iced saline; no sustained desaturation or arrhythmia.\nDisposition: Extubated in OR and transferred to PACU, then surgical floor in stable condition.",

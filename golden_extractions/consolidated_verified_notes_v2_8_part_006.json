PFTs show restrictive pattern with DLCO 45% predicted. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to whole lung lavage were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)\nATTENDING: Dr. Richard Brown\nASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Daniel Martinez\nRT: Sarah Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus\nThe patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.\nThe bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.\nLavage Procedure:\nThe patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37\u00b0C) 0.9% normal saline.\nSerial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:\n\nAliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment\nAliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment\nAliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid\nAliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid\nAliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid\nAliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear\n\nTotal volume instilled: 6000mL\nTotal volume returned: 5820mL\nNet balance: -180mL (absorbed)\nThe effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.\nAfter completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT position was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nLavage fluid (first aliquot) sent for cell count, cytology, and periodic acid-Schiff staining\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Rodriguez underwent successful whole lung lavage of the left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Procedure completed without complications. Patient will undergo right lung lavage in 4-6 weeks pending clinical response. Post-procedure CXR shows expected mild bilateral infiltrates, no pneumothorax. Plan for 6-minute walk test and PFTs in 4 weeks to assess response. GM-CSF therapy to be discussed with pulmonology.",

    "note_text": "Patient: Brian Foster\nMRN: 6927483\nDate of Procedure: December 7, 2016\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy\n\nSurgeon: Daniel Carter, MD\nAssistant: Monica Taylor, MD\nIndications: Left mainstem obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nOn initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.\n\nAt this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.\n\nSubsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Await tissue diagnosis\n\u2022 ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung\n\u2022 If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent\n\nDaniel Carter, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Initial airway inspection was unremarkable.\nStation 4R (Right paratracheal):\n\nSize: 24mm (short axis)\nEcho Features: Heterogeneous, irregular borders, comet-tail artifacts suggestive of calcification\nPET SUV: 8.5\n\nInitial TBNA with 21G needle was performed (3 passes). ROSE showed predominantly inflammatory cells with necrotic debris, non-diagnostic.\nIntranodal Forceps Biopsy Technique:\nThe EBUS 21G needle was used to create a tract through the bronchial wall and nodal capsule under real-time ultrasound guidance. The needle was removed and 1.1mm mini-forceps were advanced through the established tract into the lymph node under ultrasound visualization. The forceps jaws were opened and visible ultrasound artifact confirmed intra-nodal position. Four core samples were obtained with visible tissue in forceps each time.\nROSE on forceps specimens: Adequate cellularity with necrotizing granulomas and multinucleated giant cells, consistent with granulomatous inflammation.\nStation 7 (Subcarinal):\n\nSize: 18mm (short axis)\nEcho Features: Similar to 4R with heterogeneous pattern\nPET SUV: 7.2\n\nSimilar intranodal forceps biopsy technique performed with 3 core samples obtained. ROSE: Granulomatous inflammation.\nHemostasis was adequate after each sampling with no immediate complications. Final inspection showed no bleeding.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. The attending, Dr. Murphy, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nStation 4R: TBNA x3 (cytology), IFB x4 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)\nStation 7: IFB x3 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Anderson underwent successful EBUS with intranodal forceps biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes. Preliminary cytology shows necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Differential includes sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, fungal infection. Awaiting AFB and fungal cultures.

    "note_text": "Patient Name: Michael Thompson\nMRN: 7294163\nDate of Procedure: March 1, 2021\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement\n\nSurgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD\nIndications: Airway obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.\n\nAirway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.\n\nTumor debulking was performed using APC to \"burn and shave\" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\n\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\n\nAfter measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Post-procedure x-ray\n- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance\n- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\n\nJennifer Williams, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology\nNaval Medical Center San Diego\n\n________________________________________",

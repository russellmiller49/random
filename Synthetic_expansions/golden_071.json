Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.\nA total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.\nAt the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Plan consideration of staged left lung lavage in 2–4 weeks depending on clinical response.",

Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.\nA total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.\nAt the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Plan consideration of staged left lung lavage in 2–4 weeks depending on clinical response.",

Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.\nA total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.\nAt the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Plan consideration of staged left lung lavage in 2–4 weeks depending on clinical response.",

Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.\nA total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.\nAt the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Plan consideration of staged left lung lavage in 2–4 weeks depending on clinical response.",

Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.\nA total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.\nAt the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Plan consideration of staged left lung lavage in 2–4 weeks depending on clinical response.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically.\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the right lung was maintained while the left lung was lavaged via the nonventilated lumen. Warmed normal saline was instilled in 800–1000 mL aliquots with chest percussion and drainage to gravity between cycles. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, then gradually became light and translucent.\nA total of 16.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 13.5 L recovered. Oxygen saturations remained above 92% throughout; no arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability were observed. No endobronchial lesions were seen and no biopsies were obtained.\nAt the end of the procedure, the left lung was suctioned free of residual fluid, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for a single-lumen tube. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the step-down unit on nasal cannula oxygen.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <15 mL\nDISPOSITION: Step-down unit for overnight monitoring.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful staged left lung whole lung lavage for PAP. Continue pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators as needed, and follow-up in interventional pulmonology clinic in 4–6 weeks.",

Following the successful right lung lavage previously, the left lung was targeted today. General anesthesia was induced, and a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube was positioned to permit right lung ventilation. The left lung was lavaged with 16.0 liters of saline in aliquots. The effluent cleared appropriately. The patient remained hemodynamically stable with excellent oxygenation throughout. Extubation occurred in the operating room.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically.\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the right lung was maintained while the left lung was lavaged via the nonventilated lumen. Warmed normal saline was instilled in 800–1000 mL aliquots with chest percussion and drainage to gravity between cycles. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, then gradually became light and translucent.\nA total of 16.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 13.5 L recovered. Oxygen saturations remained above 92% throughout; no arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability were observed. No endobronchial lesions were seen and no biopsies were obtained.\nAt the end of the procedure, the left lung was suctioned free of residual fluid, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for a single-lumen tube. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the step-down unit on nasal cannula oxygen.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <15 mL\nDISPOSITION: Step-down unit for overnight monitoring.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful staged left lung whole lung lavage for PAP. Continue pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators as needed, and follow-up in interventional pulmonology clinic in 4–6 weeks.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically.\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the right lung was maintained while the left lung was lavaged via the nonventilated lumen. Warmed normal saline was instilled in 800–1000 mL aliquots with chest percussion and drainage to gravity between cycles. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, then gradually became light and translucent.\nA total of 16.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 13.5 L recovered. Oxygen saturations remained above 92% throughout; no arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability were observed. No endobronchial lesions were seen and no biopsies were obtained.\nAt the end of the procedure, the left lung was suctioned free of residual fluid, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for a single-lumen tube. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the step-down unit on nasal cannula oxygen.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <15 mL\nDISPOSITION: Step-down unit for overnight monitoring.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful staged left lung whole lung lavage for PAP. Continue pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators as needed, and follow-up in interventional pulmonology clinic in 4–6 weeks.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically.\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the right lung was maintained while the left lung was lavaged via the nonventilated lumen. Warmed normal saline was instilled in 800–1000 mL aliquots with chest percussion and drainage to gravity between cycles. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, then gradually became light and translucent.\nA total of 16.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 13.5 L recovered. Oxygen saturations remained above 92% throughout; no arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability were observed. No endobronchial lesions were seen and no biopsies were obtained.\nAt the end of the procedure, the left lung was suctioned free of residual fluid, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for a single-lumen tube. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the step-down unit on nasal cannula oxygen.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <15 mL\nDISPOSITION: Step-down unit for overnight monitoring.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful staged left lung whole lung lavage for PAP. Continue pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators as needed, and follow-up in interventional pulmonology clinic in 4–6 weeks.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically.\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the right lung was maintained while the left lung was lavaged via the nonventilated lumen. Warmed normal saline was instilled in 800–1000 mL aliquots with chest percussion and drainage to gravity between cycles. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, then gradually became light and translucent.\nA total of 16.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 13.5 L recovered. Oxygen saturations remained above 92% throughout; no arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability were observed. No endobronchial lesions were seen and no biopsies were obtained.\nAt the end of the procedure, the left lung was suctioned free of residual fluid, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for a single-lumen tube. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the step-down unit on nasal cannula oxygen.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <15 mL\nDISPOSITION: Step-down unit for overnight monitoring.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful staged left lung whole lung lavage for PAP. Continue pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators as needed, and follow-up in interventional pulmonology clinic in 4–6 weeks.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 35 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically.\nThe patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the right lung was maintained while the left lung was lavaged via the nonventilated lumen. Warmed normal saline was instilled in 800–1000 mL aliquots with chest percussion and drainage to gravity between cycles. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, then gradually became light and translucent.\nA total of 16.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 13.5 L recovered. Oxygen saturations remained above 92% throughout; no arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability were observed. No endobronchial lesions were seen and no biopsies were obtained.\nAt the end of the procedure, the left lung was suctioned free of residual fluid, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for a single-lumen tube. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the step-down unit on nasal cannula oxygen.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <15 mL\nDISPOSITION: Step-down unit for overnight monitoring.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful staged left lung whole lung lavage for PAP. Continue pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators as needed, and follow-up in interventional pulmonology clinic in 4–6 weeks.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway was secured with a 39 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated and right lung lavage commenced. Warmed 0.9% saline was instilled via the right lumen in 1 L aliquots with gentle percussion and passive drainage. After a total of 10.0 L instilled and 7.5 L recovered, the patient developed progressive desaturation to 78% despite recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and brief return to two-lung ventilation.\nGiven refractory hypoxemia, additional lavage cycles were aborted. Residual fluid was suctioned, and two-lung ventilation was re-established. The double-lumen tube was left in place for ongoing ventilatory support. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Significant hypoxemia requiring early termination of lavage and ongoing mechanical ventilation.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nDISPOSITION: Remained intubated and transported to the ICU for further management.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Incomplete right lung whole lung lavage for PAP due to hypoxemia. Continue mechanical ventilation and supportive care in ICU. Consider repeat lavage once gas exchange stabilizes.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway was secured with a 39 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated and right lung lavage commenced. Warmed 0.9% saline was instilled via the right lumen in 1 L aliquots with gentle percussion and passive drainage. After a total of 10.0 L instilled and 7.5 L recovered, the patient developed progressive desaturation to 78% despite recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and brief return to two-lung ventilation.\nGiven refractory hypoxemia, additional lavage cycles were aborted. Residual fluid was suctioned, and two-lung ventilation was re-established. The double-lumen tube was left in place for ongoing ventilatory support. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Significant hypoxemia requiring early termination of lavage and ongoing mechanical ventilation.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nDISPOSITION: Remained intubated and transported to the ICU for further management.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Incomplete right lung whole lung lavage for PAP due to hypoxemia. Continue mechanical ventilation and supportive care in ICU. Consider repeat lavage once gas exchange stabilizes.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway was secured with a 39 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated and right lung lavage commenced. Warmed 0.9% saline was instilled via the right lumen in 1 L aliquots with gentle percussion and passive drainage. After a total of 10.0 L instilled and 7.5 L recovered, the patient developed progressive desaturation to 78% despite recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and brief return to two-lung ventilation.\nGiven refractory hypoxemia, additional lavage cycles were aborted. Residual fluid was suctioned, and two-lung ventilation was re-established. The double-lumen tube was left in place for ongoing ventilatory support. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Significant hypoxemia requiring early termination of lavage and ongoing mechanical ventilation.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nDISPOSITION: Remained intubated and transported to the ICU for further management.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Incomplete right lung whole lung lavage for PAP due to hypoxemia.

General anesthesia was induced and the airway was secured with a 39 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated and right lung lavage commenced. Warmed 0.9% saline was instilled via the right lumen in 1 L aliquots with gentle percussion and passive drainage. After a total of 10.0 L instilled and 7.5 L recovered, the patient developed progressive desaturation to 78% despite recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and brief return to two-lung ventilation.\nGiven refractory hypoxemia, additional lavage cycles were aborted. Residual fluid was suctioned, and two-lung ventilation was re-established. The double-lumen tube was left in place for ongoing ventilatory support. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Significant hypoxemia requiring early termination of lavage and ongoing mechanical ventilation.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nDISPOSITION: Remained intubated and transported to the ICU for further management.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Incomplete right lung whole lung lavage for PAP due to hypoxemia. Continue mechanical ventilation and supportive care in ICU. Consider repeat lavage once gas exchange stabilizes.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway was secured with a 39 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated and right lung lavage commenced. Warmed 0.9% saline was instilled via the right lumen in 1 L aliquots with gentle percussion and passive drainage. After a total of 10.0 L instilled and 7.5 L recovered, the patient developed progressive desaturation to 78% despite recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and brief return to two-lung ventilation.\nGiven refractory hypoxemia, additional lavage cycles were aborted. Residual fluid was suctioned, and two-lung ventilation was re-established. The double-lumen tube was left in place for ongoing ventilatory support. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Significant hypoxemia requiring early termination of lavage and ongoing mechanical ventilation.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nDISPOSITION: Remained intubated and transported to the ICU for further management.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Incomplete right lung whole lung lavage for PAP due to hypoxemia. Continue mechanical ventilation and supportive care in ICU. Consider repeat lavage once gas exchange stabilizes.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 7.5 endotracheal tube. Lung isolation was achieved with selective mainstem intubation during the thoracoscopic portion.\nBedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate free-flowing left pleural effusion and identified a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a 1.5 cm incision was made and a trocar was introduced into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid. Approximately 1400 mL of fluid were drained.\nA 10 mm thoracoscope was inserted. Systematic inspection revealed diffuse fine nodularity over the parietal pleura, most prominent along the diaphragmatic and posterior costal pleura. Multiple pleural biopsies were obtained from abnormal-appearing areas using biopsy forceps. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle cautery and tamponade.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the existing incision and secured to suction at -20 cm H2O. No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion. Await pleural pathology and cytology. Daily chest tube output monitoring and CXR in the morning.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 7.5 endotracheal tube. Lung isolation was achieved with selective mainstem intubation during the thoracoscopic portion.\nBedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate free-flowing left pleural effusion and identified a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a 1.5 cm incision was made and a trocar was introduced into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid. Approximately 1400 mL of fluid were drained.\nA 10 mm thoracoscope was inserted. Systematic inspection revealed diffuse fine nodularity over the parietal pleura, most prominent along the diaphragmatic and posterior costal pleura. Multiple pleural biopsies were obtained from abnormal-appearing areas using biopsy forceps. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle cautery and tamponade.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the existing incision and secured to suction at -20 cm H2O. No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion. Await pleural pathology and cytology. Daily chest tube output monitoring and CXR in the morning.",

      "note_text": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nProcedure: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies (left hemithorax)\nPatient: Linda Jacobs, 63-year-old female with recurrent left exudative pleural effusion.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nIndication: Recurrent symptomatic left pleural effusion with two prior nondiagnostic thoracenteses; evaluation for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter informed consent was reviewed, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite and placed in the right lateral decubitus position. General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 7.5 endotracheal tube. Lung isolation was achieved with selective mainstem intubation during the thoracoscopic portion.\nBedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate free-flowing left pleural effusion and identified a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a 1.5 cm incision was made and a trocar was introduced into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid. Approximately 1400 mL of fluid were drained.\nA 10 mm thoracoscope was inserted. Systematic inspection revealed diffuse fine nodularity over the parietal pleura, most prominent along the diaphragmatic and posterior costal pleura. Multiple pleural biopsies were obtained from abnormal-appearing areas using biopsy forceps. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle cautery and tamponade.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the existing incision and secured to suction at -20 cm H2O. No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion. Await pleural pathology and cytology. Daily chest tube output monitoring and CXR in the morning.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 7.5 endotracheal tube. Lung isolation was achieved with selective mainstem intubation during the thoracoscopic portion.\nBedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate free-flowing left pleural effusion and identified a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a 1.5 cm incision was made and a trocar was introduced into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid. Approximately 1400 mL of fluid were drained.\nA 10 mm thoracoscope was inserted. Systematic inspection revealed diffuse fine nodularity over the parietal pleura, most prominent along the diaphragmatic and posterior costal pleura. Multiple pleural biopsies were obtained from abnormal-appearing areas using biopsy forceps. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle cautery and tamponade.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the existing incision and secured to suction at -20 cm H2O. No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion. Await pleural pathology and cytology. Daily chest tube output monitoring and CXR in the morning.",

General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 7.5 endotracheal tube. Lung isolation was achieved with selective mainstem intubation during the thoracoscopic portion.\nBedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate free-flowing left pleural effusion and identified a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a 1.5 cm incision was made and a trocar was introduced into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid. Approximately 1400 mL of fluid were drained.\nA 10 mm thoracoscope was inserted. Systematic inspection revealed diffuse fine nodularity over the parietal pleura, most prominent along the diaphragmatic and posterior costal pleura. Multiple pleural biopsies were obtained from abnormal-appearing areas using biopsy forceps. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle cautery and tamponade.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the existing incision and secured to suction at -20 cm H2O. No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion. Await pleural pathology and cytology. Daily chest tube output monitoring and CXR in the morning.",

      "note_text": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nProcedure: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies (left hemithorax)\nPatient: Linda Jacobs, 63-year-old female with recurrent left exudative pleural effusion.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nIndication: Recurrent symptomatic left pleural effusion with two prior nondiagnostic thoracenteses; evaluation for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter informed consent was reviewed, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite and placed in the right lateral decubitus position. General anesthesia was induced and the airway secured with a 7.5 endotracheal tube. Lung isolation was achieved with selective mainstem intubation during the thoracoscopic portion.\nBedside ultrasound confirmed a moderate free-flowing left pleural effusion and identified a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a 1.5 cm incision was made and a trocar was introduced into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid. Approximately 1400 mL of fluid were drained.\nA 10 mm thoracoscope was inserted. Systematic inspection revealed diffuse fine nodularity over the parietal pleura, most prominent along the diaphragmatic and posterior costal pleura. Multiple pleural biopsies were obtained from abnormal-appearing areas using biopsy forceps. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle cautery and tamponade.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the existing incision and secured to suction at -20 cm H2O. No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion. Await pleural pathology and cytology. Daily chest tube output monitoring and CXR in the morning.",

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid.

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 1800 mL were drained.\nA thoracoscope was inserted. Inspection revealed diffuse parietal pleural nodularity and a partially trapped right lower lobe. Targeted parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from diaphragmatic and posterior chest wall regions and hemostasis was achieved with cautery. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly over the parietal pleural surfaces to perform talc poudrage pleurodesis.\nA 24 Fr chest tube was positioned through the same incision and secured to -20 cm H2O suction. The lung re-expanded partially with residual basilar loculations consistent with trapped lung.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion. Continue chest tube suction with daily CXRs and drainage monitoring; consider tunneled pleural catheter if trapped lung persists.",

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 1800 mL were drained.\nA thoracoscope was inserted. Inspection revealed diffuse parietal pleural nodularity and a partially trapped right lower lobe. Targeted parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from diaphragmatic and posterior chest wall regions and hemostasis was achieved with cautery. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly over the parietal pleural surfaces to perform talc poudrage pleurodesis.\nA 24 Fr chest tube was positioned through the same incision and secured to -20 cm H2O suction. The lung re-expanded partially with residual basilar loculations consistent with trapped lung.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion. Continue chest tube suction with daily CXRs and drainage monitoring; consider tunneled pleural catheter if trapped lung persists.",

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 1800 mL were drained.\nA thoracoscope was inserted. Inspection revealed diffuse parietal pleural nodularity and a partially trapped right lower lobe. Targeted parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from diaphragmatic and posterior chest wall regions and hemostasis was achieved with cautery. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly over the parietal pleural surfaces to perform talc poudrage pleurodesis.\nA 24 Fr chest tube was positioned through the same incision and secured to -20 cm H2O suction. The lung re-expanded partially with residual basilar loculations consistent with trapped lung.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion. Continue chest tube suction with daily CXRs and drainage monitoring; consider tunneled pleural catheter if trapped lung persists.",

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 1800 mL were drained.\nA thoracoscope was inserted. Inspection revealed diffuse parietal pleural nodularity and a partially trapped right lower lobe. Targeted parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from diaphragmatic and posterior chest wall regions and hemostasis was achieved with cautery. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly over the parietal pleural surfaces to perform talc poudrage pleurodesis.\nA 24 Fr chest tube was positioned through the same incision and secured to -20 cm H2O suction. The lung re-expanded partially with residual basilar loculations consistent with trapped lung.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion. Continue chest tube suction with daily CXRs and drainage monitoring; consider tunneled pleural catheter if trapped lung persists.",

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 1800 mL were drained.\nA thoracoscope was inserted. Inspection revealed diffuse parietal pleural nodularity and a partially trapped right lower lobe. Targeted parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from diaphragmatic and posterior chest wall regions and hemostasis was achieved with cautery. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly over the parietal pleural surfaces to perform talc poudrage pleurodesis.\nA 24 Fr chest tube was positioned through the same incision and secured to -20 cm H2O suction. The lung re-expanded partially with residual basilar loculations consistent with trapped lung.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and talc pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion. Continue chest tube suction with daily CXRs and drainage monitoring; consider tunneled pleural catheter if trapped lung persists.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line.

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung. Initiate home drainage three times weekly, adjust based on output. Oncology follow-up as scheduled.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung. Initiate home drainage three times weekly, adjust based on output. Oncology follow-up as scheduled.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis.

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung. Initiate home drainage three times weekly, adjust based on output. Oncology follow-up as scheduled.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung. Initiate home drainage three times weekly, adjust based on output. Oncology follow-up as scheduled.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung. Initiate home drainage three times weekly, adjust based on output. Oncology follow-up as scheduled.",

Following anesthetic induction, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea, where it was attached to the jet ventilator. A flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope.\nUpon initial inspection, the trachea and right lung appeared normal, without evidence of endobronchial disease. The mid-left mainstem showed mucosal changes consistent with submucosal tumor involvement and lymphatic obstruction but was patent. At the LC2 carina, there was extensive tumor infiltration causing 100% obstruction of the left upper lobe and 95% obstruction of the left lower lobe. Purulent secretions were observed, and bronchial lavage with specimen collection for culture was performed.\nForceps biopsy was carried out on the visible endobronchial tumor, and samples were placed in formalin. The tumor was friable and bled upon contact. APC was used to revascularize the tumor, and a combination of flexible and rigid forceps, as well as cryotherapy, was employed for debulking. Additional biopsy samples were also collected and preserved in formalin.\nDuring the procedure, a Fogarty balloon was passed into the lower lobe, inflated, and retracted in an attempt to open the airway. Copious purulent secretions were observed and suctioned following the maneuver. Despite this, due to the extent of the disease, adequate recanalization of the airway could not be achieved.\nThe patient experienced two episodes of significant hypoxia, with saturations dropping into the 50s. This required clot extraction, repositioning, and direct oxygen insufflation via the flexible bronchoscope. Saturations later stabilized to >90%.\nAttempts to recanalize the airways were unsuccessful due to extensive disease. APC was again used for hemostasis. No further debulking was considered warranted at this time.\nOnce we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for continued care.\nComplications:\n\u2022\tNone\nEstimated Blood Loss: \n\u2022\t100cc\nRecommendations:\n\u2022\tAdmit to ICU for overnight observation with a bronchial blocker available in case of massive hemoptysis.\n\u2022\tObtain a chest X-ray (CXR).\n\u2022\tAwait biopsy results.\n\u2022\tInitiate palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) based on biopsy findings, as required.",

The T190 video bronchoscope was inserted orally via a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and navigated into the tracheobronchial tree, ensuring proper placement of the LMA. Observation of the vocal cords revealed no abnormalities, and the subglottic space was unremarkable. Initial examination showed the trachea and right lung to be normal, with no signs of endobronchial disease. The left mainstem from the proximal to mid-sections appeared normal. However, an endobronchial tumor was discovered in the distal left mainstem, causing approximately 85% airway obstruction. Successfully bypassing the initial obstruction, we visualized the LC2 carina extensively infiltrated by the tumor, completely obstructing the left lower lobe and obstructing 85% of the left upper lobe's takeoff. The tumor extended into the left upper lobe, fully obstructing it and compressing the lingula, which remained patent and unaffected. Following this, the Q190 bronchoscope was replaced with the UC180F convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope, introduced orally through the LMA and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree for a thorough assessment of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Stations 2R, 7, and 4L met the sampling criteria (5mm short-axis diameter), and station 4R, although smaller than 5mm, appeared round and hypoechoic, indicating suspicion. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed with Olympus EBUS TBNA 21 and 25-gauge needles on these nodes in the order of 4R, 2R, 7, and then 4L, with five biopsies taken at each station. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) found lymphocytes in all stations with no tumor invasion. The EBUS then provided ultrasound visualization of the lung mass in the distal left mainstem, with two 21-gauge needle passes yielding cytology samples without obvious tumor presence. All samples were forwarded for routine cytology analysis. Re-inserting the T190 bronchoscope, endobronchial biopsies of the tumor were performed, indicating malignancy through touch preps.\n\nSubsequently, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was placed into the airway, connecting to a jet ventilator. A flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid one for additional forceps biopsies on the tumor, with samples preserved in formalin. The tumor was de-vascularized using argon plasma coagulation (APC) and gradually debulked through a \"burn and shave\" method using flexible forceps, supplemented by cryotherapy for effective tumor removal. During the procedure, a Fogarty balloon was employed in the lower lobe to facilitate airway opening, revealing and suctioning significant purulent secretions post-maneuver, and bronchial lavage for culture was conducted. Switching to the P190 ultra-slim bronchoscope revealed that tumor infiltration was evident throughout the left lower lobe into the distal segments. We then brought our attention to the left upper lobe and were able to visualize the superior and inferior lingula segments and subsegmental carinas, which showed no tumor infiltration. We were able to bypass the proximal tumor in the left upper lobe proper and open the proximal aspect of the anterior and apical posterior segments, however tumor presence was noted distally within the airways. Given the extensive nature of the disease, no further debulking was warranted, as re-cannulation would not be successful. After ensuring no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and the patient's care was transferred back to the anesthesia team for ongoing management.\nComplications:\n\u2022\tNone Immediate \nEstimated Blood Loss: \n\u2022\t15cc\nRecommendations:\n\u2022\tTransfer the patient to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).\n\u2022\tObtain a chest X-ray.\n\u2022\tAwait the results of the biopsy.\n\u2022\tComplete staging with PET and MRI of the brain, followed by presentation at the tumor board.\n\u2022\tDischarge with a 7-day course of Augmentin.",

The patient was positioned supine and underwent general anesthesia with an 8.5 mm ETT. Using the Olympus Q190 standard video-bronchoscope, the trachea was inspected and appeared clear. The left bronchial tree was visualized and found to be normal.\nThe right mainstem bronchus was clear, while the right upper lobe exhibited submucosal tumor growth with patent airways. The proximal bronchus intermedius (BI) displayed normal luminal structure with approximately 15% obstruction from extraluminal tumor. The distal BI was normal. The right middle lobe (RML) had 80% obstruction due to submucosal infiltration. The right lower lobe (RLL) was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.\nThe bronchoscope was exchanged for an EBUS scope. A 2.5 cm lymph node in station 11R1 was identified and biopsied using a 22G ViziShot-2 needle. Five passes were performed, and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy.\nThe procedure was then switched to a therapeutic bronchoscope (3.2 mm working channel). Forceps biopsies were taken from the proximal RLL, followed by tumor cryoextraction and ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC). A Fogarty balloon catheter was used to remove distal tumor and debris. Airway dilation of the RLL was performed with an 8-9-10 mm Elation balloon dilator.\nThe RLL superior segment remained near-completely obstructed, but visualization revealed mostly uninvolved basilar segments with minimal tumor involvement. A 10 x 15 mm Aero stent was placed in the RLL, with the proximal edge positioned just distal to the RML and jailing the superior segment. The basilar segments were patent beyond the stent. The stent was further dilated using a 10-11-12 mm Elation balloon. Post-procedure, the RLL was approximately 85% patent.\nThe procedure concluded without complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).\nComplications:\nNone.\nEstimated Blood Loss:\nMinimal.\nRecommendations:\n1.\tTransfer to PACU for post-procedural monitoring.\n2.\tReturn to inpatient service when appropriate.\n3.\tAwait pathology results for NGS and PD-L1 analysis.\n4.\tNotify the oncology team at UCSD of the findings and procedural outcomes.",

The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscope and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within apico-posterior branch of left upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion. Although we were able to navigate directly to the lesion with navigation the radial probe view was suboptimal. Biopsy was performed initially with triple needle brush and TBNA needle. ROSE did not reveal evidence to support that we were within the lesion. Multiple attempts were made to manipulate the catheter and biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, and forceps, brush under fluoroscopic visualization. The specimens reviewed on-site remained suboptimal.  Multiple forceps biopsies were performed within the location of the lesion and placed in cell-block. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None \nCOMPLICATIONS:                 None\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- S/P bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage.\n- Suboptimal navigational localization \nRECOMMENDATIONS\n- Transfer to post-procedural unit\n- Post-procedure CXR\n- D/C home once criteria met\n- Await pathology",

The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscope and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within apico-posterior branch of left upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion. Although we were able to navigate directly to the lesion with navigation the radial probe view was suboptimal. Biopsy was performed initially with triple needle brush and TBNA needle. ROSE did not reveal evidence to support that we were within the lesion. Multiple attempts were made to manipulate the catheter and biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, and forceps, brush under fluoroscopic visualization. The specimens reviewed on-site remained suboptimal.  Multiple forceps biopsies were performed within the location of the lesion and placed in cell-block. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None \nCOMPLICATIONS:                 None\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- S/P bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage.\n- Suboptimal navigational localization \nRECOMMENDATIONS\n- Transfer to post-procedural unit\n- Post-procedure CXR\n- D/C home once criteria met\n- Await pathology",

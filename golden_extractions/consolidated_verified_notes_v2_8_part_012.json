    "note_text": "PATIENT NAME: Rodriguez, Maria G.\nMEDICAL RECORD NUMBER: 2025-IP-9847\nDATE OF BIRTH: 03/08/1955 (Age 70 years)\nPROCEDURE DATE: October 15, 2025\nINSTITUTION: Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nFELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)\nANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nLeft lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule\n\nCLINICAL SCENARIO:\nPatient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. \n\nGeneral anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. \n\nOlympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:\n- Normal supraglottic structures\n- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy\n- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.\n\nRegistration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). \n\nSteerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.\n\nFluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).\n\nCryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:\n\nCycle 1: \n- Freeze time: 6 minutes\n- Temperature at probe tip: -165\u00b0C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20\u00b0C)\n\nCycle 2:\n- Freeze time: 6 minutes  \n- Temperature: -167\u00b0C\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes\n\nCycle 3:\n- Freeze time: 5 minutes\n- Temperature: -163\u00b0C\n- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)\n\nThroughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.\n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.\n\nCryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:\n- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)\n- No hemorrhage\n- No airway perforation\n- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)\n\nComplete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. \n\nBronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target\n2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)\n3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS\n4. No procedural complications\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nDRAINS/TUBES: None placed\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring\n2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry\n3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications\n4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging\n5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain\n6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)\n7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen\n8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake\n9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated\n10. Diet as tolerated\n11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course\n- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)\n- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation\n- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually\n\nDISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:\nExtensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.\n\nTotal procedure time: 94 minutes\nFluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  \nRadiation dose: 287 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\nATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.\n\n___________________________________________\nKevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nAssociate Professor of Medicine\nDirector of Advanced Bronchoscopy Fellowship\nDivision of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine\nStanford University School of Medicine\n\nCo-signed by:\nLisa Nguyen, MD (Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellow, PGY-6)\n\nProcedure dictated: 10/15/2025 16:45\nTranscribed: 10/15/2025 17:20\nElectronically authenticated: 10/15/2025 18:05",

Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nMODIFIED INDICATION: \nGiven active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.\n\n**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**\n\nPatient still with chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.\n\nPROCEDURE (Performed 11/08/2025, 0800hrs):\nGeneral anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.\n\nRFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:\n- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis\n- Then standard ablation (90\u00b0C x 8min) for tumor treatment\n- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment\n\nOUTCOME: \nSuccessfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None additional\n\nMODIFIED PLAN:\n- ICU monitoring continues\n- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr\n- CT chest at 48hr  \n- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved\n\n**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**\nThis represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure. Case to be presented at morbidity/mortality conference for systems review of management pathway.\n\nDr. Anthony Russo, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology - Tampa General\nAttending on call for emergent procedures\n\nCase reviewed with: Dr. Sarah Kim (Thoracic Surgery), Dr. James Liu (Interventional Radiology), Dr. Patricia Mendez (Pulmonary Critical Care)",

Anderson\nMRN: 8472-9315\nDOB: 03/15/1958 (Age: 67)\nDate of Procedure: 10/12/2025\nInstitution: Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA\nAttending Physician: Dr. Sarah Chen, MD, FCCP\nFellow: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, MD\nAnesthesia: Dr. Patricia Williams, MD\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nRight upper lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.3 cm, highly suspicious for primary lung adenocarcinoma. Patient deemed high surgical risk due to severe COPD (FEV1 38% predicted) and coronary artery disease with prior CABG.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nBronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right upper lobe peripheral nodule\n\nINDICATION:\n67-year-old gentleman with 45 pack-year smoking history presents with incidentally discovered 2.3 cm spiculated nodule in right upper lobe posterior segment. PET-CT demonstrates SUV max 8.4. Transthoracic needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Patient evaluated by thoracic surgery but deemed prohibitive surgical risk. Multidisciplinary tumor board recommended bronchoscopic ablation vs SBRT. Patient elected for bronchoscopic microwave ablation after extensive discussion of risks and benefits.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nAfter informed consent, patient brought to interventional pulmonology suite. Time-out performed. General anesthesia induced with propofol and rocuronium, patient intubated with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope advanced through ETT after securing airway. Initial survey bronchoscopy revealed patent airways without endobronchial lesions. \n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy performed using superDimension system with prior thin-slice CT protocol. Planning software identified target nodule in RUL posterior segment (RB1). Navigation successful with 8 steerable guide sheath advanced to peripheral location. Radial EBUS performed demonstrating target lesion in contact position with characteristic hypoechoic appearance. Target confirmed with cone-beam CT showing guide sheath within 5mm of lesion center.\n\nExtended working channel passed through guide sheath. Microwave ablation probe (Emprint 2.0, 15mm active tip) advanced through EWC to target site. Ablation parameters: 65 watts, 5 minute duration. Temperature monitoring showed gradual rise to 85\u00b0C at probe tip. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation. Post-ablation radial EBUS demonstrated hyperechoic changes consistent with coagulative necrosis. \n\nGuide sheath slowly withdrawn under direct visualization. Inspection revealed mild mucosal edema but no active bleeding. Airways suctioned clear. Patient emerged from anesthesia without complications. Extubated in suite and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal\nFLUIDS: 800 mL crystalloid\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nSPECIMENS: None sent\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RUL posterior segment target\n2. Microwave ablation completed per protocol with good real-time monitoring\n3. Post-ablation imaging confirms appropriate zone of coagulation\n\nPLAN:\n1. Admit for overnight observation\n2. Chest CT with contrast in 6 hours to assess for complications\n3. Pain control with scheduled acetaminophen and PRN oxycodone\n4. Incentive spirometry q2h while awake\n5. Follow-up CT chest in 6 weeks to assess treatment response\n6. Close PET-CT surveillance at 3, 6, and 12 months\n\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to 7 West pulmonary intermediate care\n\n_________________________________\nSarah Chen, MD, FCCP\nDirector, Interventional Pulmonology",

    "note_text": "PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Thompson, David W. | MRN: 95-847-2631 | DOB: 12/07/1951\nPROCEDURE DATE: September 28, 2025\nLOCATION: University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA\nPROCEDURALIST: Elizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP\nASSISTANT: Jennifer Lee, DO (IP Fellow, PGY-6)\nANESTHESIOLOGIST: Robert Chang, MD, MBA\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nRight lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated 09/15/2025, with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on 08/30/2025 yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above\n\nPROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:\n1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey\n2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance\n3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion\n4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule\n5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:\nThis is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.\n\nDETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.\n\nAnesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.\n\nOlympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from 09/20/2025 loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) identified and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.\n\nNavigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.\n\nCone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.\n\nExtended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90\u00b0C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.\n\nAfter completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90\u00b0C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.\n\nGuide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.\n\nAirways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution\nSPECIMENS SENT: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion\n2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones\n3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves\n4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage\n5. No immediate procedural complications identified\n\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven RLL peripheral adenocarcinoma, poor surgical candidate, status post successful bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Procedure technically successful with good positioning and ablation parameters. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary Intermediate Care Unit (7 East) for overnight observation\n2. Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry monitoring overnight\n3. Chest radiograph in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute complications\n4. CT chest with intravenous contrast in 24 hours to assess ablation zone and rule out complications\n5. Pain management: scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg q8h, oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN moderate pain, hydromorphone 0.5mg IV q4h PRN severe pain\n6. Aggressive pulmonary toilet: incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake, chest physiotherapy as needed\n7. Empiric antibiotics NOT indicated at this time given low infection risk\n8. Anticipated discharge tomorrow if overnight course uncomplicated and CT scan reassuring\n9. Follow-up arrangements: Clinic visit in 1 week with CXR, CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment, PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response\n10. Continue home medications including COPD regimen, cardiac medications\n11. Patient and family extensively counseled on post-procedure expectations, warning signs for complications (increasing dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis), importance of follow-up\n\nI have personally performed and supervised this entire procedure. All findings, interventions, and recommendations above represent my direct involvement and assessment.\n\nProcedure time: 87 minutes (includes anesthesia induction and emergence)\nFluoroscopy time: 3.2 minutes\nRadiation dose: 245 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\n_______________________________________\nElizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP\nProfessor of Medicine\nDirector, Interventional Pulmonology\nUniversity of Washington Medical Center\n\nElectronically signed: 09/28/2025 14:37 PST",

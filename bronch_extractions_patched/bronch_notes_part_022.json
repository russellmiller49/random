    "note_text": "Procedure Name: Peripheral radial EBUS guided bronchoscopy\nIndications: left lower lobe pulmonary nodule \nMedications: via anesthesia assistance  \nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left lower lobe to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy and unable to clearly identify that adequate sampling was performed.  \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful peripheral radial probe guided eccentric localization \n- Will await final pathology results",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 800cc of dark bloody fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There were multiple thick adhesions and areas of lung tethering to the posterior chest wall. We were unable to identify the diaphragm or apex due to fused lung that would have required extensive lysis to pass. There was extensive inflammation in the adhered lung which we could peel away relatively easily in the thinner areas to expose parietal pleura which was generally normal appearing.  The 5mm port could not fit the optical forceps and we then exchanged the it for a disposable 8mm trochar. Biopsies of the parietal pleura posteriorly as well as areas of non-ventilated fused lung adherent to the pleural (non-functional appearing) were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was no significant bleeding. The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. \n\nPleurX Catheter Placement:\n\nA guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract. A 16 fr peel away sheath was inserted over the wire via seldinger technique. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and minimal serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The patient\u2019s wife was then brought into the room for drainage draining and a PleurX bottle was attached to the catheter and approximate 75cc of bloody fluid was obtained. The catheter tip was then capped and the PleurX was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing. \n\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed pleural catheter in place.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 75cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion \nRecommendation:\nWill await pathology and microbiological studies\nPatient education on pleural catheter draining performed and patient and wife will return to clinic if needed for more training.",

The T190 video bronchoscope was then introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational map created preprocedurally we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the right upper lobe nodule. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion.  A super dimension needle was then inserted through the bronchoscope and 0.75 milliliters of isocyanate Green were injected just below the pleura adjacent to the nodule for planned robotic surgical resection immediately following. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was turned over to cardiothoracic surgery. \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   less than 5 cc \nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nIMPRESSION:  \n- Successful navigational bronchoscopy with ICG marking of right upper lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below.   The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. There were no complications. Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await final pathology results\nStation:\tEBUS Size (mm)\tNumber of passes\tROSE Findings\n11Rs\t3.7\t0\t\n11Ri\tN/A\t0\t\n4R\t4.0\t0\t\n2R\t3.3\t0\t\n2L\t3.3\t0\t\n4L\t3.7\t0\t\n7\t4.9\t0\t\n11L\t7.0\t6\tLymphocytes\nLung Mass\t31.5\t8\tMalignancy",

After patient's clinic visit while I was in a separate room with another patient the patient abruptly entered and indicated that he was choking and couldn't breathe.  He was quickly taken into the bronchoscopy suite at which point lidocaine was injected into his right Nair and deep tracheal suction was attempted with tracheal suction catheter however symptoms persisted.  The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through his right Nair without sedation and into his posterior oropharynx where additional 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords.  The bronchoscope was then passed into the trachea where a thick plug of mucus was visualized and suctioned.  We then inspected the airways further and found other areas of mucus within both the right and the left-sided airways and within his left-sided mainstem stent there was adherent thick mucus causing approximately 50% obstruction which was also suctioned with about 95% recanalization of the stent.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.  The patient\u2019s symptoms completely resolved and he was sensibly sent to the emergency department for evaluation and possible admission given the acute severe event.\nComplications none",

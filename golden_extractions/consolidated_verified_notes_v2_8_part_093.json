Drainage has decreased to <50mL per session over the past 3 weeks. CT chest from 11/28/2025 demonstrates near-complete resolution of right pleural effusion with evidence of pleurodesis. Patient referred for IPC removal.\n\nPROCEDURE: Removal of indwelling tunneled pleural catheter (CPT 32552)\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine (10mL)\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nThe patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position. The right lateral chest wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The catheter exit site was identified. Local anesthesia was infiltrated along the subcutaneous tunnel tract. A small incision was made at the catheter exit site extending along the tunnel. The cuff was identified approximately 2cm from the exit site within the subcutaneous tissue. Using blunt dissection, the cuff was freed from surrounding tissue. The catheter was then withdrawn smoothly from the pleural space. The tract was inspected and hemostasis confirmed. The incision was closed with 3-0 nylon sutures. Sterile dressing applied.\n\nFINDINGS:\n- PleurX catheter removed intact with cuff\n- No purulent drainage or signs of infection\n- Minimal serous fluid at tract site\n- Total catheter length: 28cm\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nEBL: <5mL\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE:\n- Post-procedure CXR obtained - no pneumothorax\n- Patient tolerated procedure well\n- Discharge home with wound care instructions\n- Follow-up in 2 weeks with repeat CXR\n\nDr. James Morrison, MD",

Urgent therapeutic thoracentesis requested.\n\nProcedure: Thoracentesis, aspiration of pleural space, without imaging guidance (32554)\n\nAnesthesia: Local - 1% lidocaine 8mL\n\nTechnique:\nPatient positioned sitting upright at bedside. Physical exam demonstrated dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at left base extending to mid-scapula. Entry site selected at 8th intercostal space, posterior axillary line based on percussion findings. Skin prepped with chlorhexidine and draped. Local anesthesia infiltrated. 18G needle advanced over superior aspect of 9th rib while aspirating. Pleural fluid obtained at 4cm depth. Catheter advanced, needle withdrawn. 1800mL straw-colored fluid removed by gravity and gentle aspiration. Procedure stopped due to patient cough. Catheter removed. Pressure dressing applied.\n\nFindings:\n- Fluid appearance: Clear, straw-colored\n- Volume removed: 1800mL\n\nComplications: None\n\nPost-procedure: Patient reports significant improvement in dyspnea.

Known history of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B). Chest X-ray shows large right pleural effusion. Hepatic hydrothorax suspected.\n\nProcedure: Thoracentesis, needle aspiration of pleural space, without imaging guidance (CPT 32554)\n\nTechnique:\nPatient positioned sitting at edge of bed leaning forward. Physical examination confirmed dullness to percussion throughout right hemithorax. Skin marked at 7th intercostal space, posterior axillary line. Sterile prep. 1% lidocaine 10mL infiltrated. 18-gauge catheter-over-needle introduced, aspirating during advancement. Pleural space entered at 5cm depth. Catheter advanced, needle removed. Fluid drained by gravity. Total 2200mL removed over 25 minutes. Catheter removed.\n\nFluid Analysis:\n- Appearance: Clear, straw-colored\n- Volume: 2200mL\n\nComplications: None. Patient denied chest pain, no cough during procedure.\n\nPost-procedure Assessment:\n- Breath sounds improved on right\n- SpO2 97% on room air (pre-procedure 91%)\n\nImpression: Successful therapeutic thoracentesis.

Patient has required 3 therapeutic thoracenteses in past 6 weeks. After multidisciplinary discussion, patient elected chemical pleurodesis over tunneled pleural catheter.\n\nProcedure: Instillation of talc slurry via chest tube for pleurodesis (CPT 32560)\n\nPre-procedure: Small-bore chest tube (14Fr pigtail) was placed 2 days ago and has drained 2800mL total. CXR today shows near-complete drainage with lung re-expansion. Output now <100mL/24h.\n\nPleurodesis Procedure:\nPatient positioned supine. Existing chest tube function confirmed with respiratory swing. Tube flushed with 20mL normal saline. Premixed talc slurry (4g talc in 50mL NS) warmed to body temperature. Slurry instilled via chest tube over 3 minutes. Tube flushed with 20mL NS. Tube clamped for 1 hour. Patient rotated to different positions every 15 minutes to distribute talc. After 1 hour, tube unclamped to suction at -20cmH2O.\n\nTalc Dose: 4 grams\n\nComplications: Patient experienced moderate pleuritic chest pain during instillation requiring IV morphine 4mg.\n\nPost-procedure Plan:\n- Continue chest tube to suction\n- Monitor output\n- CXR daily\n- Remove tube when output <150mL/24h\n\nDr. Richard Thompson, MD",

Decision made for left-sided talc pleurodesis.\n\nPre-procedure: Left 12Fr pigtail catheter placed yesterday. Total output 1600mL. Today's CXR shows adequate drainage with lung re-expansion.\n\nProcedure Performed: Instillation of talc slurry via chest tube for chemical pleurodesis (CPT 32560)\n\nTechnique:\nConsent verified. Patient positioned semi-recumbent. Pre-medication: morphine 4mg IV, ondansetron 4mg IV. Sterile talc 5g mixed with 100mL warmed NS. Slurry instilled slowly over 5 minutes via chest tube. Tube flushed with 20mL NS. Tube clamped. Patient rotated through positions every 15 minutes for total dwell time of 90 minutes. Tube then placed to water seal, then suction at -20cmH2O.\n\nAgent: Talc 5g in 100mL NS (slurry)\nDwell Time: 90 minutes with position changes\n\nComplications: Mild pleuritic discomfort. Temperature 37.8C 4 hours post-procedure.\n\nBrian Lee, MD",

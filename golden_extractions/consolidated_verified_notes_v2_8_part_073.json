Topical 1% lidocaine applied to the oropharynx and vocal cords. The patient maintained spontaneous ventilation via native airway with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter a time-out and confirmation of consent, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced orally with a bite block. The vocal cords were mobile and normal in appearance. The trachea and main carina were normal with mild extrinsic impression at the subcarinal region but no endobronchial tumor. The right and left bronchial trees were inspected to the subsegmental level without obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang transbronchial aspiration needle was passed through the working channel. Using anatomic landmarks only (no EBUS or ultrasound), multiple passes were made through the bronchial wall just proximal to the main carina targeting the subcarinal (station 7) lymph node seen on imaging (short-axis 15 mm). Four needle passes were performed with suction applied on each pass, yielding blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: An on-site cytotechnologist was present. Rapid on-site evaluation showed abundant lymphocytes with clusters of malignant epithelial cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Adequacy was confirmed after the third pass; a fourth pass was performed for cell block and ancillary studies.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 7 conventional TBNA x4 passes, submitted for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry with reflex molecular studies if malignant.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Minimal oozing at the puncture site resolved with suction and cold saline. No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was used at any point; this was a purely conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was monitored in the bronchoscopy recovery area and discharged home in stable condition. Final cytology, cell block, and molecular profiling from station 7 will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board. Further management (surgical resection versus chemoradiation or systemic therapy) will be based on complete staging results.",

Size 8.0 ETT secured. The patient was ventilated mechanically throughout the procedure.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter standard pre-procedure checks and a surgical time-out, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The vocal cords and proximal trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp with mild external impression posteriorly. No intraluminal tumor was seen in either mainstem bronchus. Segmental bronchi in both lungs were free of obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was advanced through the bronchoscope working channel. Using anatomic landmarks only (no EBUS system available in the OR), the subcarinal (station 7) lymph node was targeted by puncturing the bronchial wall just proximal and slightly posterior to the main carina. Three needle passes were performed with suction. Each pass yielded blood-tinged material with visible tissue cores.\n\nROSE: On-site cytology was available. Rapid evaluation demonstrated cellular samples with lymphocytes and malignant epithelial cells compatible with metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma. Adequacy was confirmed after the second pass; a third pass was obtained for additional cell block material.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 7 conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, and PD-L1/molecular profiling as indicated.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or arrhythmia. No EBUS, radial probe, or navigational bronchoscopy was used; this was a purely conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to the PACU in stable condition. She will follow up in thoracic oncology clinic within 1 week to review final pathology and discuss resection versus combined-modality therapy.",

Topical 1% lidocaine to nasopharynx, vocal cords, and trachea. The patient breathed spontaneously via native airway with supplemental oxygen.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter informed consent and a procedural time-out, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced orally. The upper airway, vocal cords, and trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp. The right bronchial tree was normal. On the left, there was mild extrinsic impression on the distal left mainstem corresponding to the paratracheal lymph node but no mucosal lesion.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang TBNA needle was advanced through the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks without EBUS guidance, the left lower paratracheal (station 4L) lymph node was targeted via the medial wall of the distal trachea just above the left mainstem origin. Four needle passes were performed with suction. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with small whitish tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: Cytotechnologist present for on-site evaluation. ROSE demonstrated abundant benign lymphocytes with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomas. No malignant cells were seen. Adequacy was confirmed after the second pass; two additional passes were obtained for culture and cell block.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4L conventional TBNA x4 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, AFB/fungal cultures, and flow cytometry.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. No linear or radial EBUS, navigation, or fluoroscopy was used; this was a blind conventional Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient recovered uneventfully in the bronchoscopy suite and was discharged home. If final pathology confirms non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, findings will be discussed with rheumatology for sarcoidosis management; if lymphoma is identified, oncology referral will be arranged.",

Anesthesiology provided induction with propofol and rocuronium; patient mechanically ventilated throughout.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter pre-procedural verification and a time-out, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea and main carina were normal. The right bronchial tree was normal. On the left, there was subtle extrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea just above the carina and mild impression on the proximal left mainstem bronchus; mucosa was intact.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was introduced via the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks (no EBUS available in this OR), the left lower paratracheal (4L) node was sampled by puncturing the medial wall of the distal trachea above the left mainstem origin. Three passes were performed with suction. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: Rapid on-site cytology was available. ROSE revealed lymphoid tissue with atypical epithelial cells; findings were suspicious for metastatic carcinoma and deemed adequate for diagnosis. Additional material was set aside for cell block and immunohistochemistry.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4L conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, and immunohistochemical staining.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, airway compromise, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was performed; this was purely a blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to PACU in stable condition. Final pathology will be correlated with prior breast cancer histology. If metastatic disease is confirmed, systemic therapy options will be discussed with oncology; if benign, further workup for granulomatous disease will be considered.",

Topical lidocaine applied to upper airway. The patient breathed spontaneously via native airway with supplemental oxygen.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter time-out and confirmation of consent, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced orally. The larynx and trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp. The right mainstem bronchus showed mild external impression along its medial wall consistent with the known 4R node; mucosa was intact. The remainder of the bronchial tree was free of obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang TBNA needle was introduced through the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks (no EBUS), the right lower paratracheal (station 4R) node was targeted from the distal trachea and proximal right mainstem bronchus. Three passes were made with suction applied. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: On-site cytology was available. ROSE demonstrated malignant epithelial cells compatible with non-small cell lung carcinoma in a lymphoid background, confirming adequacy after the second pass. A third pass was obtained for cell block.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4R conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology and cell block with reflex molecular studies.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Minimal self-limited bleeding from the puncture site; no hypoxia or arrhythmia. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigation was performed; this was conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient recovered uneventfully in the bronchoscopy recovery area and was discharged home. Staging will be finalized once cytology and imaging are integrated; case to be presented at lung tumor board for definitive treatment planning.",

Anesthesiology provided induction with propofol and rocuronium; patient mechanically ventilated throughout.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing a formal time-out, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea and main carina appeared normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed minimal extrinsic impression along its medial wall. No endobronchial tumor or secretions were seen in either lung.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was passed through the bronchoscope working channel. Under anatomic landmark guidance only (no EBUS system used), the right lower paratracheal (4R) node was sampled via the distal trachea and proximal right mainstem bronchus. Four aspiration passes were performed with suction. All passes yielded blood-tinged material with tissue fragments adequate for cytology and cell block.\n\nROSE: Rapid on-site evaluation by cytology demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in a lymphoid background, confirming N2 involvement. Adequacy was established after the second pass; additional passes were dedicated to cell block and molecular testing.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4R conventional TBNA x4 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding or hypoxia. No linear EBUS, radial probe, or navigation was used; this was conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to PACU in stable condition. Results will be reviewed with thoracic surgery and medical oncology; given confirmed N2 disease, multimodality therapy rather than primary surgery is anticipated.",

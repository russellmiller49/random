IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies.
This resulted in >40% increased work due to Technical difficulty of procedure and Physical and mental effort required.
Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe. 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.
The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus.
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	14	400	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.
Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).
Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   
 
Significant difficulties were encountered during the navigation due to a small carina.
5mmx20mm mustang balloon was used to dilate the distal airway under direct fluoro-guidance with Omnipaque 240 as inflation agent.
After dilation, the robotic bronchoscope was easily navigated to the distal nodule under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target.
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.
The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.
Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.
This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.
The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).
Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.
I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.
Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.
Total 2 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.
Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.
Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.
Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.
Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.
Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics.
Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy.
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable.
The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics.
The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable.
The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics.
The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions.
Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Site 3: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable.
The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics.
The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
Site 4: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable.
The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics.
The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.
At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

A microdebrider was used to excise residual tumor tissue until a near-circular lumen was achieved. Multiple tumor fragments were removed and sent for pathology. Residual narrowing estimated at 25%; no stent placed due to anticipated systemic therapy response.\nComplications: Brisk bleeding during initial passes controlled with iced saline, topical epinephrine, and temporary tamponade with the rigid barrel.\nDisposition: Remained intubated and transferred to the MICU for overnight observation and treatment of pneumonia.",

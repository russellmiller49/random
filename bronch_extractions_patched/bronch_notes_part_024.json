After patient's clinic visit while I was in a separate room with another patient the patient abruptly entered and indicated that he was choking and couldn't breathe.  He was quickly taken into the bronchoscopy suite at which point lidocaine was injected into his right Nair and deep tracheal suction was attempted with tracheal suction catheter however symptoms persisted.  The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through his right Nair without sedation and into his posterior oropharynx where additional 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords.  The bronchoscope was then passed into the trachea where a thick plug of mucus was visualized and suctioned.  We then inspected the airways further and found other areas of mucus within both the right and the left-sided airways and within his left-sided mainstem stent there was adherent thick mucus causing approximately 50% obstruction which was also suctioned with about 95% recanalization of the stent.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.  The patient\u2019s symptoms completely resolved and he was sensibly sent to the emergency department for evaluation and possible admission given the acute severe event.\nComplications none",

All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. \n \nPATIENT POSITION: . \n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. \n \nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nvcv\t14\t375\t12\t100\t10\t15\n \nTarget 1: Lingular nodule\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. \n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.\n \nCone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. \n \nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.\n \nTransbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nTransbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).\n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).\n \nFiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. \n \nROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:\nConclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm\n \nPrior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.\n \nTarget 2: LUL anterior\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. \n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.\n \nCone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. \n \nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.\n \nCryobiopsy was attempted but was technically challenging - unable to penetrate the airway wall to achieve consistent biopsy.\n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:\nConclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm\n \nPrior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.\n \n200mg of TXA was placed into LUL to achieve hemostasis. \n \nEBUS-Findings\nIndications: Diagnostic\nTechnique:\nAll lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.\n \nLymph node sizing was performed by EBUS.\n \nLymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node\n4L (lower paratracheal) node\n7 (subcarinal) node\n10R lymph node\n10L lymph node\n11Rs lymph node\n11Ri lymph node\n11L lymph node\n \nNo immediate complications\n \nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1\u20133), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. \n \nLymph Nodes Evaluated:\nSite 1: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.\n \n \nSite 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node waswas < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.\n \nAll other lymph node stations did not have any detectable lymph nodes noted. \n \n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nTBNA, TBCBX, Brush, BAL lingula nodule\nTBNA LUL nodule.\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN:  Erica Nunley is a 88 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung nodules.\n- f/u in clinic for results\n \nGeorge Zhi Cheng, MD, PhD\n12/17/2025",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\n \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\n \nPROCEDURE:  \n31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode\n31623 Dx bronchoscope/brushing    \n31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    \n31628 TBBX single lobe     \n31629 TBNA single lobe   \n31626 Fiducial marker placements, single or multiple     \n31627 Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted)\n77012 Radiology / radiologic guidance for CT guided needle placement (CIOS)\n76377 3D rendering with interpretation and reporting of CT, US, Tomo modality (ION Planning Station)\n31653 EBUS sampling 3 or more nodes  \n31654 Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion\n76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion\n76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Targets \n76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Target 2\n \n \nATTENDING:  \nDuane Johnson MD PhD\n \nASSISTANT:   none\n \nSupport Staff: \nRN: Maribel Dean\nRT: Mary Moore \n \nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n \nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n \nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nLinear EBUS \nRadial EBUS\nIon Robotic Bronchoscope\nDisposable Bronchoscope\n \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None\n \nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n \nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. \n \nPATIENT POSITION: . \n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n \nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. \n \nVentilation Parameters:\n\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nvcv\t14\t375\t15\t100\t10\t20\n \nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB10).  Target lesion is about 1.5 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. \n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .\n \nCone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. \n \nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.\n \nTransbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nTransbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).\n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).\n \nFiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. \n \nROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:\nCells present causing suspicion of malignant neoplasm\n \nPrior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.\n \nEBUS-Findings\nIndications: Diagnostic and Diagnostic and Staging\nTechnique:\nAll lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.\n \nLymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.\n \nLymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node\n4L (lower paratracheal) node\n7 (subcarinal) node\n10R lymph node\n10L lymph node\n11Rs lymph node\n11Ri lymph node\n11L lymph node\n \nNo immediate complications\n \nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1\u20133), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. \n \nLymph Nodes Evaluated:\nSite 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\n \nSite 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.\n \nSite 3: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nRLL TBCBX, TBNA, Brush, BAL\nTBNA 11R, 11L, 7\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Leticia Rayos is a 58 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung nodule.\n- f/u in clinic\n- f/u cxr\n \nDuane Johnson , MD, PhD\n12/17/2025",

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.\n \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.\n \nPROCEDURE:  \n31899 Unlisted Procedure (Trach Change with Mature Tract or Procedure NOS)\n31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode\n31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    \n31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)\n31628 TBBX single lobe     \n31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes\n31654 Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion\n76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion\n76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Targets \n76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Target 2\n \n \nIP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: \nUnusual Procedure:\nThis patient required a EBUS lymph node forceps/cryo biopsies. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Technical difficulty of procedure and Physical and mental effort required.

All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. \n \nPATIENT POSITION: . \n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n \nNBI was used to assess the airway and nodular changes was noted. \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. \n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nEndobronchial biopsy was performed at RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), and LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1).  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the lesion LLL is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .  No vessels were noted. \n \nTransbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps at Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.\n \nEBUS-Findings\nIndications: Diagnostic\nTechnique:\nAll lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.\n \nLymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle, 19-gauge Needle, and Cryoprobe 1.1mm.\n \nLymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node\n4L (lower paratracheal) node\n7 (subcarinal) node\n10R lymph node\n10L lymph node\n11Rs lymph node\n11Ri lymph node\n11L lymph node\n \nNo immediate complications\n \nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1\u20133), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. \n \nLymph Nodes Evaluated:\nSite 1: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided Transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\n \nSite 2: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. \n \nSite 3: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. \n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nEBBX, TBBX\nBAL\nStation 7 - TBCBX, TBNA\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Rick Smith is a 32 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for possible sarcoid.\n- f/u in clinic\n \nDuane Johnson , MD, PhD\n12/17/2025",

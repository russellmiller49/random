Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.\nThe patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.\nA total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.\nAt the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene. Plan consideration of staged left lung lavage in 2\u20134 weeks depending on clinical response.",

No talc pleurodesis or tunneled pleural catheter was performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~30 mL\nDISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to wall suction.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies and drainage of a recurrent left exudative effusion.

General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line.

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound identified a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung.

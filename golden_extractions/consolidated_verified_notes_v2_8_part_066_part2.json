ETT secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nTrachea normal caliber, carina sharp. Bilateral airways inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial lesions. Minimal secretions cleared.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t14\t383\t18\t80\t5\t18\n\nThe single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.\n\nThe scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the LLL (LB9) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 4.1mm.\n\nOnce in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 2.1cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to atelectasis.\n\nThe augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.\n\nThe scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.\n\nRadial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Concentric.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G needle. 7 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nCytology brushings obtained. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Atypical cells, cannot exclude malignancy\n\nFinal airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or complications. The disposable Galaxy scope was removed and discarded at the end of the case.\n\nPatient tolerated procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nPark, MD",

ETT secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nTrachea normal caliber, carina sharp. Bilateral airways inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial lesions. Minimal secretions cleared.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t10\t351\t14\t100\t5\t24\n\nThe single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.\n\nThe scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the LLL (LB10) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 2.4mm.\n\nOnce in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 1.9cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to respiratory motion.\n\nThe augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.\n\nThe scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.\n\nRadial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G needle. 6 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nROSE Result: Suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma\n\nFinal airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or complications. The disposable Galaxy scope was removed and discarded at the end of the case.\n\nPatient tolerated procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nBrown, MD",

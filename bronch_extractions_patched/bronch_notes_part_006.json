All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 90 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. Endobronchial brushing was performed at the takeoff of the right upper lobe followed by endobronchial biopsies within the right upper, right middle and left upper lobe for research purposes as per standard DECAMP protocol.  The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Rs and station 711L lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the attached EBUS procedural sheet. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 45 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound failed to confirm location on multiple attempts and we subsequently removed the ENB catheter and were able to locate the lesion based on anatomical knowledge with the white light bronchoscope and confirm target with radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization followed by BAL of the segment.  ROSE showed malignancy within the target lesion in the left upper lobe.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. \n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful and biopsy of left upper lobe mass with malignancy identified on primary evaluation. \n- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation \n- Await final pathology",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7 and 11L. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot  EBUSTBNA 19 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then tried to visualize the FDG avid station 5 lymph node seen on PET CT through the pulmonary artery but were unable to clearly visualize the node and thus could not sample from the mainstem approach (transvascular). We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy. At this point the patient had lost her IV access and developed laryngospasm prompting us to bronchoscopically intubate the patient with a size 8.5 ETT which was easily passed through the vocal cords and into the lower trachea before being secured in place. The Q190 bronchscope was then advanced, using anatomical knowledge,  into the proximal left upper lobe adjacent to the station 5 lymph node and utilizing radial EBUS attempted to sample this node through an airway approach with a transbronchial needle approach. ROSE was unrevealing and we subsequently the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement was attempted once we were in the vicinity of the point of interest with radial ultrasound. The lesion however could not be adequately visualized. Multiple attempts to navigate to the lesion were unfruitful and we subsequently completed the procedure without attempting to sample the left upper lobe peripheral lesion. \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation \n- Flexible bronchoscopy with unsuccessful electromagnetic navigation to the left upper nodule\n- Await final pathology  \n- Discharge once post-op criteria met",

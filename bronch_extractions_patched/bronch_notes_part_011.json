All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords were normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 90 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the right lower lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful navigational biopsy of right lower lobe nodule.  \nRecommendations\n- Await final pathology",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4LR,7, and 4R lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4L Lymph node followed by 7, and 4R lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. The 4L lymph node was extremely difficult to access due to angle of left mainstem and after one biopsy no further attempts performed. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet which is available in AHLTA. ROSE showed non-diagnostic tissue in the 4L and 4R lymph nodes and benign lymphocytes in the station 7 lymph node. All samples were sent for routine cytology. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Recommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU and home per protocol\n- Will await final pathology results",

    "note_text": "INDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  \nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the endotracheal tube was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. Due to hypoxia and difficulty obtaining sufficient chest wall expansion the decision was made to convert to conventional ventilation. The rigid bronchsocpe was attached to the conventional ventilator adapter the mouth was packed and the side ports were closed to allow closed system ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the proximal bronchus intermedius a completely obstructive tumor with overlying blood clot was seen. The right upper lobe however was widely patent. Using cryotherapy probe we removed the overlying blood clot and were able to better visualize the obstructive tumor which originated at the medial aspect of the BI with a wide based stock. A small opening was seen at the lateral aspect but was too small to visualize and open airways distally. Due to high oxygen requirements and persistent hypoxemia we were unable to utilize thermal therapies for debulking.  We thus advanced to the rigid bronchoscope into the proximal bronchus intermedius and using the beveled tip attempted to apple core the proximal edge of the lesion which allowed for us to then cryo-debulk the lesion with a lower risk of developing an area repair.  Two large pieces of tumor were successfully removed with carotid debulking and we were then able to advance the bronchoscope passed the obstruction into the distal bronchus intermedius where we could visualize the right middle lobe and the orifice of the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe.  Extensive purulent material consistent with postobstructive pneumonia was seen and suctioned into a trap to be sent for culture.  At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 20mm x 10mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the bronchus intermedius allowing aeration of the right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, and the distal airways to include the right middle and right lower lobe including the superior segment.  Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was re-intubated fiber-optically without difficulty \nRecommendations:\nTransfer patient back to the ICU\nAttempt extubation when deemed appropriate by ICU team with goal of patient transferring to home for end-of-life/hospice care.",

    "note_text": "POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n1.\tResolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent \nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem\nINDICATIONS: extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. The left vocal cord was noted to be fixed consistent with vocal cord paralysis. Muscle relaxants were then given and we then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Airway inspection was performed and there were thick purulent secretions throughout the airways which were suctioned. In the mid to distal trachea there was approximately 30-40% obstruction from posterior extrinsic compression. The right mainstem was approximately 15% obstructed at the proximal orifice and opened up to be widely patent distally.  The right-sided airways were free of endobronchial disease in the mucosa was normal.  On the left there was significant airway obstruction beginning at the orifice of the left mainstem with friable erythematous mucosa causing approximately 40% obstruction however in the mid left mainstem there is significant protrusion of extrinsic mass with likely some degree of submucosal infiltration resulting in about 90-95% airway obstruction.  The therapeutic bronchoscope could not pass the lesion.  We then attempted to pass lesion with the diagnostic Q 190 bronchoscope and were also unsuccessful. We then again attempted to pass lesion with the ultrasound P190 bronchoscope which was successfully able to bypass lesion.  Approximately 5 mm proximal to the LC2 carina the airways open to near normal luminal diameter.  There were thick postobstructive secretions at all left-sided airways which were suctioned. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed along with the LMA and a 10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. There is a significant week which impaired ability to ventilate and multiple attempts at packing the mouth were unsuccessful.  The 10 mm rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13 mm non-ventilating tracheoscope was introduced in the airway in a similar fashion with the hope that this would eliminate/reduce the ventilator leak however similar issues arose and we subsequently decided to remove the rigid bronchoscope and perform the procedure through a 8.5 ET tube which was placed by anesthesia.  There was some hypoxia for a few minutes mostly in the mid 80s but for a short period time in the upper 70s which was likely related to the recruitment from the time period of inadequate ventilation which eventually resolved allowing us to continue with the procedure. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed however slightly too distally and was retracted into proper position with forceps. Balloon dilatation was then performed of the stent which only partially open due to significant external compression using a 10/11/12 CRE balloon which expanded the stent with only mild deformity with a subsequent diameter of the left mainstem approximately 80% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. \nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer back to ward\n-\tPost-procedure x-ray\n-\tStart 3% saline nebs 3cc combined with 2cc albuterol 3 times daily for stent maintenance. \n-\tEnsure supplemental oxygen is humidified \n-\tPlease arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.",

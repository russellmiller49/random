    "note_text": "PATIENT: Williams, Janet S. || MRN: PFA-2025-447 || DOB: 05/19/1967\nDATE OF PROCEDURE: November 18, 2025\nINSTITUTION: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH\nOPERATOR: Dr. Richard Patel, MD (Director, Thoracic Innovation Laboratory)\n\nPRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Left upper lobe peripheral nodule, 1.9 cm, proven squamous cell carcinoma\n\nPROCEDURE: Bronchoscopic Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) of pulmonary nodule - INVESTIGATIONAL\n\n*** INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) PROTOCOL #BR-PFA-2024-017 ***\n*** FDA-APPROVED CLINICAL TRIAL: PULSE-LUNG Phase II Study ***\n\nINFORMED CONSENT: Extended discussion with patient regarding investigational nature of pulsed field ablation for lung tumors. Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nGeneral anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.\n\nABLATION PARAMETERS:\n- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds\n- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  \n- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz\n- Number of treatment cycles: 3\n- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds\n- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)\n- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:\nAdvanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).\n\nOUTCOMES: \nSuccessfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.\n\nNOVEL FINDINGS: \nPFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.\n\nDISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis. Patient enrolled in long-term registry (5-year follow-up).\n\nResearch coordinator contacted. Data forms completed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nStudy PI: Richard Patel, MD\nProtocol: PULSE-LUNG-002",

Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL APPROACH:\nGiven the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.\n\nSedation Protocol:\nDeep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.\n\nTechnical Details:\nThe electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension\u2122) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.\n\nThe extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.\n\nRadiation Exposure:\nTotal fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes\nDose-area product: 268 cGy\u00b7cm\u00b2\n(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)\n\nSampling Protocol:\nFollowing tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:\n- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens\n- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nSmall apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.\n\nQUALITY METRICS:\n- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved\n- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)\n- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete\n- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology\n\nDISCUSSION:\nThis case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",

CT chest shows 3.2cm RUL mass with bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy. PET-CT reveals primary lesion SUV 9.4, multiple N2 stations PET-avid (4R, 7, 2R).\n\nProcedure Performed:\n1. EBUS-TBNA for staging\n2. Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy\n\nAnesthesia: Moderate sedation\n- Midazolam 3mg IV + Fentanyl 75mcg IV\n- Ramsay sedation scale: 3 (responds to commands)\n- Monitoring: BP q5min (stable 125-135/72-85), continuous SpO2 (96-99%)\n\nProcedure Details:\n\nEBUS Component:\nSystematic mediastinal evaluation following N3\u2192N2\u2192N1 protocol.\n\nStation 2R (12mm):\n- 4 passes with 22G needle\n- ROSE: Positive for malignant cells\n- PET+\n\nStation 4R (18mm):\n- 5 passes (extra for molecular)\n- ROSE: Positive for malignant cells\n- PET+\n- Sent for NGS panel\n\nStation 7 (21mm):\n- 4 passes\n- ROSE: Positive for malignant cells\n- PET+\n\nStation 10R (9mm):\n- 3 passes\n- ROSE: Adequate, benign\n\nComplete photodocumentation of accessible stations performed \u2713\n\nBronchoscopy Component:\nExamination of airways revealed mass effect from RUL tumor with partial narrowing of RUL bronchus (~40%). Multiple forceps biopsies obtained from tumor (n=6). Brush cytology x2 also performed.\n\nModerate bleeding from biopsy sites controlled with topical epinephrine 1:20,000 + iced saline lavage.\n\nAssessment:\n- N2/N3 disease confirmed (multi-level, multi-station)\n- Primary tumor biopsied\n- Adequate tissue for histologic diagnosis and molecular profiling\n- Stage IIIB (clinical)\n\nComplications:\n- Moderate airway bleeding (controlled, no intervention required beyond topical measures)\n- Severity: Moderate\n\nPlan:\n- Multidisciplinary tumor board presentation\n- Await molecular results (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1)\n- Likely concurrent chemoradiation vs neoadjuvant approach\n\nPatient Recovery: Stable, discharged after 2 hours",

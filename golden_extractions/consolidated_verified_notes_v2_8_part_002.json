    "note_text": "Name: Elizabeth Okafor\nMedical Record Number: 2034958\nDate of Birth: 03/15/1959 (65 years old)\nSex: Female\nDate of Service: October 25, 2024\nTime In: 07:30 | Time Out: 11:45 | Total Procedure Time: 4 hours 15 minutes\n\nCARE TEAM\n\nPrimary Operator: David Kim, MD - Interventional Pulmonology (Attending)\nAssistant Operator: Rachel Foster, MD - Interventional Pulmonology Fellow (PGY-6)\nAnesthesiologist: Margaret Sullivan, MD\nCRNA: James Torres, CRNA\nCirculating RN: Patricia Martinez, RN\nScrub Tech: Anthony Garcia, CST\nRespiratory Therapist: Michelle Chen, RRT\n\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION\nMrs. Okafor is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:\n\nRight mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung\nMalignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)\nRight malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells\n\nThe patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING\nPre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:\n\nAddress airway obstruction first (most critical)\nFollow with pericardial window creation\nComplete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates\n\nINFORMED CONSENT\nExtensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:\n\nBleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)\nPerforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)\nArrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)\nHypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)\nNeed for ICU care postoperatively (expected)\nMortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)\n\nBenefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.\nAlternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).\nPatient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\n\nRecurrent adenocarcinoma of right lung with endobronchial obstruction (C34.11)\nMalignant pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology (I31.3, C38.0)\nMalignant pleural effusion, right (J91.0)\nRespiratory failure, acute on chronic (J96.20)\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\nSame as preoperative\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n\nRigid bronchoscopy with endobronchial tumor debridement\nElectrocautery and argon plasma coagulation of endobronchial tumor\nBalloon dilation of right mainstem bronchus stenosis\nMetallic airway stent placement, right mainstem bronchus\nFlexible bronchoscopy with inspection and therapeutic aspiration\nSubxiphoid pericardial window creation (performed by CT surgery)\nPericardial biopsy\nTunneled pleural catheter placement, right hemithorax\n\nCPT CODES\n\n31640 (Bronchoscopy with tumor excision)\n31641 (Bronchoscopy with destruction of tumor)\n31630 (Bronchoscopy with dilation)\n31631 (Bronchoscopy with stent placement)\n31645 (Bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration)\n33015 (Pericardial window, subxiphoid)\n32550 (Insertion of indwelling pleural catheter)\n\n\nANESTHESIA DETAILS\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nInduction: Fentanyl 150mcg IV, Propofol 180mg IV, Rocuronium 50mg IV\nMaintenance: Sevoflurane 1.5-2.5% with intermittent propofol boluses, Fentanyl infusion\nAirway: Initial 8.0mm oral endotracheal tube, exchanged to rigid bronchoscope\nMonitoring:\n\nStandard ASA monitors (ECG, NIBP, pulse oximetry, capnography, temperature)\nArterial line - left radial artery\nCentral venous catheter - right internal jugular (placed by anesthesia for access/monitoring)\nTransesophageal echocardiography probe (for pericardial window portion)\nNeuromuscular blockade monitoring\n\nHemodynamics: Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout with MAP 65-85mmHg, HR 75-95 bpm. Vasopressor support with phenylephrine intermittent boluses (total 400mcg). Post-pericardial drainage, improvement in cardiac output noted on TEE.",

    "note_text": "OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE\nPART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)\nPatient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:\n\nCorrect patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)\nProcedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)\nPositioning (supine throughout)\nAntibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)\nSteroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)\nBlood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)\n\nInitial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.\nInitial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:\nOlympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:\n\nSupraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions\nVocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses\nSubglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis\nTrachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions\nCarina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy\nLeft main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter\nLUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent\nRight main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.\n\nDecision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.\nRigid Bronchoscopy Phase:\nPatient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.\nVentilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.\nThe rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.\nMechanical Debridement:\nUsing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.\nEstimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue\nHemostasis Measures:\nAs expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:\n\nIced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.\nTopical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.\nTranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.\n\nAfter approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.\nElectrocautery:\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.\nTreatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus\nTreatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time\nEffect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis\nArgon Plasma Coagulation:\nAPC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.\nTreatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.\nDuration: 6 minutes active APC time\nResult: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface\nAssessment after debridement:\nRight mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.\nBalloon Dilation:\nBoston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nInflation sequence:\n\nFirst inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nSecond inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nThird inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)\n\nFluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.\nPost-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.\nStent Placement:\nAfter discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.\nStent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length\nDeployment technique:\n\nStent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance\nPositioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus\nFluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views\nSlow, controlled deployment under direct visualization\nPost-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion\n\nPost-stent assessment:\nFlexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.\nFindings:\n\nStent well-positioned, no migration\nExcellent apposition to airway walls\nRUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent\nRML orifice: Visible and patent\nRLL orifice: Visible and patent\nAll segments of right lung now visualized for first time\nSignificant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nExtensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:\n\nRight upper lobe: Approximately 30mL\nRight middle lobe: Approximately 20mL\nRight lower lobe: Approximately 40mL\n\nTotal secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.\nFinal Airway Inspection:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nLeft bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent\nRight main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)\nRUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation\nMinimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent\n\nRigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).\nAirway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM\nEstimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL\nSpecimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)\n\nPART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)\nPatient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.\nTEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.\nSurgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):\n\nSubxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm\nDissection carried down to pericardium\nPericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created\nRush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid\nPericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)\nNo active bleeding from pericardial surface\n19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space\nDrain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction\n\nTEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.\n\nPART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)\nWith patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.\nUltrasound examination (performed by IP team):\n\nRight hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion\nEstimated volume: 1000-1200mL\nAnechoic fluid, no loculations\nCompressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)\n\nPleurX catheter placement:\nStandard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.\nInitial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).\nChest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.\n\nPROCEDURE CONCLUSION\nAll procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.\nPatient Status at Conclusion:\n\nHemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)\nImproved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)\nTEE shows improved cardiac function\nBilateral breath sounds now audible\n\nPatient kept intubated for transport to ICU given length of procedure and concern for post-obstructive pulmonary edema.\nSpecimens Sent:\n\nEndobronchial tumor (histology)\nBronchial secretions (bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures)\nPericardial tissue (histology, cytology)\nPericardial fluid (cytology, chemistry)\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nEstimated Total Blood Loss: 250mL\nFluids Given: 2000mL crystalloid\nUOP: 400mL\nComplications: None intraoperatively\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN\nImmediate (ICU):\n\nExtubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)\nChest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days\nMonitor pericardial drain output\nPleural catheter to drain q3 days initially\nContinue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)\nDVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ\nPPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis\nAggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry\n\nShort-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):\n\nRemove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day\nTransition to floor when stable\nContinue PleurX catheter drainage\nPain control\nPhysical therapy for reconditioning\n\nMedium-term (1-2 weeks):\n\nDischarge with home health for PleurX catheter management\nFollow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray\nDiscuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved\n\nLong-term:\n\nSurveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent\nMonitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)\nMay need stent revision/exchange\nPleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life\n\n\nASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS\nMrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:\n\nNear-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction \u2192 Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent\nCardiac tamponade physiology \u2192 Successfully addressed with pericardial window\nLarge pleural effusion \u2192 Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter\n\nAll procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:\n\nRestored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)\nResolution of cardiac compromise\nControl of pleural effusion\n\nPrognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.\nThe patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT\nI, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.\nThe procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.\nElectronically Signed: David Kim, MD - 10/25/2024 13:05\nBRONCHOSCOPY 10/27/24\nJackson Mary 82F #2145069\nIndication pneumonia not improving on abx, r/o endobronchial lesion\nModerate sedation versed 2mg fent 75mcg\nScope thru nose, lidocaine spray used\nFindings:\nNose/pharynx ok\nCords move normal\nTrachea normal\nR side all patent no lesions\nL side all patent no lesions\nDiffuse thick yellow secretions throughout both lungs\nBAL done LLL 100cc in 80cc out\nSputum cultures sent\nNo lesions seen\nPost bronch CXR no PTX\nImpression: No endobronchial cause for pneumonia, likely bacterial pneumonitis, cultures pending\nPlan: Continue abx, f/u cultures, repeat CXR 48h\nDr. Smith",

Endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)\n2. Ion robotic navigational bronchoscopy\n3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound\n4. Transbronchial biopsy\n\n**CPT CODES:** 31652, 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n\n**INDICATIONS:**\n55-year-old female with 35 pack-year smoking history presents with:\n- Right lower lobe mass, 3.4cm, PET SUV 9.2\n- Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Station 4R (2.1cm, SUV 5.8), Station 7 (1.8cm, SUV 4.3)\n- Requires both nodal staging and peripheral mass biopsy for diagnosis and treatment planning\n\n**CONSENT:**\nComprehensive informed consent obtained. Risks discussed including but not limited to: bleeding (1-5%), pneumothorax (1-3%), infection (<1%), mediastinal complications (pericardial/vascular injury <0.1%), need for additional procedures, anesthesia-related complications. Patient expressed understanding and agreed to proceed.\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\nGeneral endotracheal anesthesia administered.\n- Induction: Propofol 200mg, Fentanyl 150mcg, Rocuronium 50mg\n- Maintenance: Sevoflurane, intermittent propofol boluses\n- ETT: 8.0mm at 22cm at teeth\n- Ventilation: Pressure control, Pinsp 18, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE TIMEOUT:**\nPerformed confirming patient identity (verbal + 2 identifiers), procedure planned, site/laterality confirmed, team introductions, equipment availability checked.\n\n**PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:**\n\n**PHASE 1: EBUS-TBNA FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING**\n\nEBUS bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC190F) introduced through ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node survey performed:\n\n**STATION 4R (Right paratracheal):**\n- Size: 22mm x 14mm\n- Ultrasound features: Hypoechoic, heterogeneous, discrete borders\n- Vascular pattern: Central hilar vessels present\n- Elastography: Predominantly hard (strain ratio 8.2, suggesting malignancy)\n- TBNA: 22-gauge needle, 4 passes\n- ROSE: \"Abundant cellularity, malignant cells present, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma\"\n\n**STATION 7 (Subcarinal):**\n- Size: 19mm x 16mm\n- Ultrasound features: Hypoechoic, round, sharp borders\n- Elastography: Firm (strain ratio 6.8)\n- TBNA: 22-gauge needle, 4 passes\n- ROSE: \"Similar malignant cells as 4R, adenocarcinoma\"\n\n**Additional Stations Surveyed but Not Sampled:**\n- Station 10R: 8mm (below size threshold)\n- Station 11R: 6mm (not sampled - diagnostic yield from 4R/7 adequate)\n- Left-sided stations: No enlarged nodes identified\n\n**PHASE 2: ION ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR RLL MASS**\n\nAfter completing EBUS, EBUS scope removed. Ion robotic bronchoscope introduced.\n\n**Navigation Setup:**\nCT chest from 11/30/2024 loaded to Ion platform. 3D reconstruction showed target in RLL posterior basal segment.\n\n**Ion Registration:**\nAutomatic registration performed. Landmarks matched at carina, RLL carina, and segmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 1.3mm (acceptable). No registration drift observed.\n\n**Navigation to Target:**\nIon catheter advanced under navigational guidance to RLL posterior basal segment. Real-time tracking showed tool-to-target distance of 0.7cm at final position.\n\n**Radial EBUS:**\n20MHz probe inserted through Ion extended working channel.\n- Pattern: Concentric (lesion centered around probe)\n- Size: 32mm diameter\n- Characteristics: Heterogeneous echogenicity, irregular margins, no visible vessels in immediate vicinity\n\n**CBCT Confirmation:**\nCone-beam CT spin acquired. NaviLink 3D fusion overlay confirmed catheter tip within lesion borders, 4mm from lesion center.\n\n**Sampling of RLL Mass:**\n- Transbronchial biopsies: 8 specimens obtained via Ion catheter\n- Cytology brushings: 3 specimens\n- Bronchial washing: sent for cytology and microbiology\n\n**ROSE (Peripheral Lesion):**\n\"Adequate samples. Malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma, morphologically similar to lymph node specimens. Recommend molecular testing.\"\n\n**HEMOSTASIS:**\nNo significant bleeding from any biopsy sites. Airways clear.\n\n**PROCEDURE COMPLETION:**\nTotal procedure time: 78 minutes\nEBUS portion: 32 minutes\nIon bronchoscopy portion: 46 minutes\n\nPatient tolerated procedure well. Extubated in OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition, SpO2 98% on 2L NC.\n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:** <10mL\n\n**SPECIMENS:**\n1. Station 4R TBNA x 4 passes (cell block + cytology)\n2. Station 7 TBNA x 4 passes (cell block + cytology)\n3. RLL mass TBBx x 8 (formalin, histopathology - **ORDER MOLECULAR TESTING**)\n4. RLL mass brushings x 3 (cytology)\n5. RLL mass washing (cytology, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures)\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**PRELIMINARY FINDINGS:**\n- N2 disease confirmed (stations 4R, 7 both positive for adenocarcinoma)\n- Primary RLL adenocarcinoma confirmed\n- Stage: At least IIIA (T2bN2M0) pending full staging workup\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:**\n1. Recovery room monitoring per protocol\n2. Chest X-ray in 2 hours to rule out pneumothorax\n3. Discharge home same day if stable and CXR clear\n4. Complete staging: Brain MRI, consider bone scan if not covered by PET\n5. Molecular testing: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, PD-L1, broader NGS panel\n6. Multidisciplinary tumor board presentation next week\n7. Medical oncology referral for neoadjuvant therapy discussion\n8. Radiation oncology consultation\n9. Follow-up in IP clinic in 1 week with full pathology results\n\n**CLINICAL IMPRESSION:**\nStage IIIA adenocarcinoma of the lung (RLL primary with N2 mediastinal involvement). Not a surgical candidate initially. Will likely require neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with consideration for surgery after response assessment vs definitive chemoradiation. Molecular profiling pending.\n\n**ATTENDING STATEMENT:**\nI was present throughout the entire procedure, personally performed the critical portions including EBUS-TBNA and supervised the Ion navigation and sampling. I reviewed all ROSE results in real-time and made all clinical decisions.\n\nElectronically signed: Dr. Nicholas Foster, 12/15/2024 16:42",

Concern for lung metastasis vs new primary. Please evaluate and biopsy if appropriate. Also noted to have enlarged subcarinal node.\"\n\n**HISTORY:**\n74F with PMH of Stage II ER+/HER2- invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed 2017, treated with lumpectomy + radiation + endocrine therapy. Developed bone and liver metastases 2023, currently on palbociclib + letrozole with stable disease.\n\nRecent surveillance CT shows new 2.8cm RLL nodule (not present on prior CT 6 months ago). Also new subcarinal lymphadenopathy 2.1cm. PET/CT: RLL nodule SUV 6.4, subcarinal node SUV 5.9.\n\nClinical question: Progression of breast cancer to lung vs. new primary lung cancer (would change management significantly).\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\nCombined EBUS-TBNA + EMN bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis with appropriate immunohistochemistry to differentiate breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.\n\nPatient agreeable, scheduled for procedure same day given oncologic urgency.\n**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:**\n\n**EBUS-TBNA + EMN Bronchoscopy + Transbronchial Biopsy**\n\nConsent obtained. Anesthesia: MAC (Dr. Roberts). ETT 7.5.\n\n**PHASE 1 - EBUS:**\n\nSurveyed mediastinum systematically.\n\nStation 7 (subcarinal):\n- 21 x 18mm, hypoechoic, round\n- 22G needle, 5 passes\n- ROSE (Dr. Williams): \"Positive for malignancy. Adenocarcinoma cells. CK7+/CK20- pattern on rapid IHC. Cannot definitively distinguish breast met vs lung primary on cytology alone - recommend tissue biopsy with full IHC panel.\"\n\nOther stations surveyed - no other enlarged nodes.\n\n**PHASE 2 - EMN to RLL nodule:**\n\nSuperDimension system. CT from 04/30/25 loaded.\nTarget: RLL lateral basal segment nodule.\n\nRegistration: Auto, 8 points, good accuracy.\n\nNavigated to target - distance 0.7cm per system.\n\nRadial EBUS: Concentric pattern, 26mm heterogeneous lesion.\n\nSampling:\n- TBBx x 8 (formalin - **REQUEST FULL IHC PANEL: TTF-1, Napsin-A, CK7, CK20, ER, PR, HER2, GATA-3, Mammaglobin**)\n- Brushings x 3\n- BAL\n\nROSE: \"Adenocarcinoma. Morphology could represent either primary lung or breast metastasis. IHC panel will be definitive.\"\n\nNo complications.

    "note_text": "Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. \nMedications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  \nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of fish mouth dynamic obstruction of the right middle lobe. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe were endobronchial tumor was visualized.  The radial EBUS probe was inserted through the bronchoscope and advanced into the airway and an eccentric view of the lesion was identified. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. ROSE identified malignancy. After adequate samples were obtained, the video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 4R and 11Rs. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation showed adequate lymphocytes in the 4R lymph node and were non-diagnostic in the 11Rs. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted again into the airway and 5 more forceps biopsies were obtained in the apical segment of the right upper lobe for cell block and molecular analysis. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Q190 re-inserted into the airways. DECAMP research samples were then performed with brushing within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies in the RUL, RML and LUL. We then observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\nComplications: \t\n-None \nEstimated Blood Loss:  5 cc.\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to post-procedure unit\n- Await biopsy results \n- Discharge home once criteria met.",

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11RS and 7. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Further details regarding nodal size and number of samples are included in the EBUS procedural sheet in AHLTA. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation did not identify malignancy. The bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe and a large sheeth catheter with radial ultrasoung to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush with fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the Q190 re-inserted into the airways. To remove secretions and blood and once confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. \n\nComplications: \t\n-None \nEstimated Blood Loss:  10 cc.\nRecommendations:\n- Admit for overnight observation given the late hour of procedural completion\n- Await biopsy results \n- Discharge home once criteria met.",

A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. Tracheomalacia was noted as we advanced the scope to the carina. The carina was sharp. The right and left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  We then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the EBUS bronchoscope into the airway. We attempted to visualize the nodule with endobronchial ultrasound but did not see the nodule with ultrasound. We then inserted the therapeutic bronchoscope for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy.  We were not able to get to the nodule using the navigation equipment.  After suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\n\nComplications: None.\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.  No specimens were obtained for path review.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Discuss his case at cardiothoracic tumor board next Tuesday to determine best next step in workup",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just distal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  We then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the P190 slim bronchoscope into the airway. We attempted to visualize endobronchial disease within the anterior basilar segment of the left lower lobe but could not advance the scope distally enough. We then inserted the radial ultrasound through the working channel of the bronchoscope and an eccentric view of the kno0wn nodule was obtained. We then performed peripheral TBNAs of the point of interest. ROSE did not show obvious malignancy. At this point we removed the slim scope and inserted the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope through the mouth, and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. We attempted to wedge the scope in the lower lobe to potentially visualize the tumor with ultrasound. We saw an unusual area of soft tissue which did not obviously look like would be expected from the nodule. Two biopsies were performed using the 22G EBUS-TBNA needle. ROSE however showed only blood. Finally, fluoroscopy was brought into the room and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left lower lobe and a large sheath catheter with radial ultrasound to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush with fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.  After suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nFollowing completion of the procedure the patient was noted to have audible upper airway sounds and ventilation was difficult.  And decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. Initially this was attempted over the bronchoscope however edema within the structures of the middle laryngeal cavity (above the vocal cords this was unsuccessful. Anesthesia was then able to intubate with the glideslope. The bronchoscope was then inserted through the ETT to confirm positioning 2cm above the carina and to suction secretions. The patient was then transferred to the ICU. \n\nComplications: Unexpected admission\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule\n- Will transfer to the ICU and attempt extubation later today. \n- Await final pathology",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. A polyp wasseen on the left vocal cord. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the right lower lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful navigational biopsy of right lower lobe nodule.  \n-Vocal Cord polyp\nRecommendations\n- Await final pathology\n- ENT consultation for eval of vocal cord polyp",

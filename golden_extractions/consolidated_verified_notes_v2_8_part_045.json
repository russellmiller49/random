Flexible bronchoscopy\n2. Endobronchial ultrasound (linear) with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) of mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes\n\nANESTHESIA:\nGeneral anesthesia with 8.5 ETT, managed by anesthesia service\n\nINDICATION:\nStaging of PET-avid mediastinal/hilar adenopathy in a patient with RUL lung mass prior to lobectomy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter informed consent, the patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and placed under general anesthesia.\nAn 8.5 mm endotracheal tube was placed by anesthesia. A standard diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was\npassed through the ETT. Full airway survey was performed. The trachea, carina, and right/left bronchial\ntree were inspected. No endobronchial lesion was seen in the central airways.\n\nThe diagnostic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT.\nSystematic nodal survey was performed.\n\nStation 4R: Enlarged, 1.5 cm short axis, hypoechoic node with discrete borders. Four EBUS-TBNA passes\nperformed using a 22G needle. Adequate material obtained, on-site smears cellular.\n\nStation 7: 1.2 cm hypoechoic subcarinal node. Four EBUS-TBNA passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE\nshowed lymphoid tissue; no complications.\n\nStation 10R: Visualized only. Node measured approximately 6\u20137 mm. No clear malignant features.\nNO sampling was performed at 10R; it was intentionally observed only.\n\nNo radial EBUS was used and no peripheral lung nodule sampling was attempted during this case.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nEBUS-TBNA station 4R x4 passes\nEBUS-TBNA station 7 x4 passes\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone. No significant bleeding or hypoxia.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nExtubated in procedure room and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nCPT (requested by operator): 31622, 31652",

Robotic bronchoscopy with computer-assisted image-guided navigation to LLL nodule\n2. Radial EBUS of LLL nodule\n3. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), LLL\n4. Linear EBUS-TBNA of mediastinal/hilar nodes (11L and 7)\n\nANESTHESIA:\nGeneral anesthesia with 8.0 ETT (anesthesia team)\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, an 8.0 ETT was placed. A robotic bronchoscope was docked (Ion system).\nPre-procedure CT was loaded and registration performed with a registration error of 2.3 mm.\n\nUsing computer-assisted navigation, the scope was advanced to the LLL target. Radial EBUS probe demonstrated\na concentric hypoechoic lesion corresponding to the CT nodule. Through the robotic working channel, standard\nforceps transbronchial lung biopsies were obtained from the LLL (5 passes) with fluoroscopic confirmation of\ntool position. No pneumothorax seen on immediate fluoroscopy.\n\nFollowing peripheral sampling, the robotic scope was removed and a linear EBUS scope was introduced through the ETT\nfor nodal staging.\n\nStation 11L: 1.0 cm node with mild PET uptake. EBUS-TBNA x4 passes (22G).\n\nStation 7: 0.9 cm node. EBUS-TBNA x3 passes (22G).\n\nNo other nodal stations were sampled. No additional peripheral lesions were targeted.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nLLL TBLB x5, EBUS-TBNA 11L and 7.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone. No hypoxia, bleeding, or pneumothorax noted intra-procedure.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nExtubated in OR and monitored in PACU before same-day discharge.\n\nCPT (requested): 31627, 31654, 31628, 31652",

Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage\n2. Attempted EBUS bronchoscopy (aborted before lymph node sampling)\n\nSEDATION:\nModerate sedation with midazolam 2 mg IV and fentanyl 75 mcg IV, native airway with nasal approach\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nAfter informed consent, patient was placed supine and topical lidocaine applied to nasopharynx. Diagnostic\nflexible bronchoscopy was performed via left naris. Vocal cords were mobile. Trachea and main bronchi without\nendobronchial lesion.\n\nGiven CT suggestion of mediastinal nodes, attempt was made to pass the linear EBUS scope through the vocal cords.\nHowever, despite additional topical anesthesia, the patient developed severe coughing and transient desaturation\nto 84%. The EBUS scope could not be advanced safely beyond the glottis and NO nodal survey or TBNA passes were performed.\n\nTo at least obtain diagnostic material, the conventional bronchoscope was reintroduced and bronchoalveolar lavage\nwas performed in the right middle lobe (120 mL in, 70 mL out). Fluid sent for cytology, AFB smear/culture, and\nfungal studies.\n\nNo biopsies (TBLB or TBNA) were performed and no EBUS images were obtained.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nBrief desaturation during attempted EBUS entry, resolved with oxygen and scope removal. No bleeding.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nObserved in step-down unit for 2 hours and discharged home the same day.\n\nCPT (requested by operator): 31652",

Vocal cords normal. Trachea and right bronchial tree\nwithout new lesions.\n\nLeft mainstem silicone stent visualized in expected position. Approximately 60\u201370% of the stent lumen was\nfilled with thick tenacious mucus. Spent 15 minutes performing aggressive suctioning and saline lavage to clear\nsecretions. After airway toilet, the stent lumen was widely patent, >80% open.\n\nStent edges inspected carefully. No evidence of migration, fracture, or tumor in-growth. Mild, non-obstructing\ngranulation tissue at the distal end (<10% circumference) noted but not treated during this session.\n\nNO balloon dilation, NO stent repositioning, and NO stent exchange were performed. This was purely a routine\nstent check and cleaning.\n\nRemaining left-sided bronchi examined and were patent without additional lesions.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nMinimal mucosal oozing controlled with cold saline. No desaturation.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nRecovered uneventfully and discharged home.\n\nCPT (requested): 31645",

A friable obstructing tumor was debulked with suction and forceps to\ncreate a working channel. No separate excision code is being considered for this case.\n\nA CRE balloon was then advanced to the right mainstem stenosis and inflated sequentially (10, 12, and 14 mm) across the same\nsegment that would receive the stent. After dilation improved luminal caliber, a covered metallic stent (14 mm x 50 mm) was\ndeployed in the right mainstem bronchus under bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. Post-deployment balloon dilation of the\nstent was performed to ensure apposition to the airway wall.\n\nAll dilation occurred in the exact segment receiving the stent; no separate lobar or segmental dilation was performed outside\nthe stented region.\n\nStent position and patency were confirmed. No additional therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nRemained intubated briefly then extubated in OR and transferred to ICU.\n\nCPT (requested): 31631, 31630",

A friable tumor was identified arising from the orifice\nof the left lower lobe bronchus, causing approximately 80% obstruction.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid barrel. Cryotherapy was performed using a 2.4 mm cryoprobe.\nThe probe was applied to the tumor surface in multiple cycles (freeze 15\u201320 seconds, passive thaw) with subsequent\nsloughing of necrotic tumor tissue. No mechanical coring, snare resection, or microdebrider excision was used.\n\nResidual tumor base and bleeding points were treated with argon plasma coagulation (APC) at 40 W, 1.5 L/min argon\nflow, with FiO2 kept at 0.35 during activation.\n\nAfter combined cryotherapy and APC, the left lower lobe bronchial lumen improved to approximately 50\u201360% patency.\nNo additional resection techniques were employed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nMild oozing controlled with APC; no hypoxia.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nExtubated in OR and transferred to PACU.\n\nCPT (requested): 31641, 31640",

Bronchoscopy performed under deep sedation on ventilator.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nFlexible bronchoscope advanced through the ETT. Large amounts of fresh blood were suctioned from trachea and\nright mainstem bronchus.\n\nRIGHT LUNG:\nRUL found to be the bleeding source with active oozing from posterior segment. No foreign body or tumor identified.\n\nHEMOSTATIC MEASURES:\n- Iced saline lavage 50 mL aliquots x4 (200 mL total) to RUL\n- Topical epinephrine 1:10,000, 10 mL instilled to RUL\n- Tranexamic acid 500 mg in 50 mL NS instilled via bronchoscope\n- No radial EBUS, navigation, or biopsies were performed\n\nFollowing these measures, bleeding slowed from brisk to scant oozing. Airway was packed with small amounts of\nsuctioned clot but remained patent. No balloon tamponade was required.\n\nLEFT LUNG:\nNormal, no blood.\n\nNo transbronchial biopsies, brushings, or BAL were performed because priority was hemorrhage control.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone beyond initial hemorrhage.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nRemain intubated in ICU, plan for IR bronchial artery embolization later this morning.\n\nCPT (requested): 31634, 31622",

Bedside ultrasound demonstrated a small but definite left pleural effusion\nwith a safe pocket of approximately 2 cm depth at the posterior axillary line.\n\nThe skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. Using real-time ultrasound guidance, a\nthoracentesis needle and catheter were advanced into the pleural space. Approximately 180 mL of straw-colored\nfluid was removed before the patient developed pleuritic chest discomfort and coughing. The procedure was\nterminated at that point, but adequate fluid was obtained for diagnostic testing.\n\nNo chest tube or tunneled catheter was placed. Post-procedure ultrasound showed residual trace fluid and no\nevidence of pneumothorax.\n\nFluid was sent for cell count, protein, LDH, glucose, cytology, and culture.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nMild chest discomfort and cough; no pneumothorax.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nObserved for 2 hours and discharged home.\n\nCPT (requested): 32555",

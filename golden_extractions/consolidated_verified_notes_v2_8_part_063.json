INDICATION FOR OPERATION: 62-year-old former smoker with a 1.8 cm left lower lobe lateral basal segment pulmonary nodule (SUV 3.5) with bronchus sign present, referred for diagnostic robotic navigational bronchoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same, malignancy suspected. PROCEDURE: Robotic navigational bronchoscopy using Intuitive Ion system (CPT 31627), radial EBUS (CPT 31654), transbronchial lung biopsy (CPT 31628), transbronchial brushing (CPT 31623). Under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, a timeout was performed and standard ASA monitoring was used. A CT-based navigation plan was loaded to the Ion platform and automatic complete registration was achieved with low fiducial error. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL lateral basal segment; radial EBUS showed a concentric heterogeneous 18 mm lesion without major vessels. Cone\u2011beam CT confirmed tool-in-lesion. Multiple forceps biopsies and brushings were obtained through the extended working channel with minimal bleeding. Final airway inspection showed no active hemorrhage or airway compromise. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications; post-procedure CXR showed no pneumothorax.",

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule in ILD. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same. PROCEDURE: Robotic navigational bronchoscopy using Intuitive Ion system (CPT 31627), radial EBUS (CPT 31654), transbronchial cryobiopsy (CPT 31632), transbronchial brushing (CPT 31623). Under general anesthesia with ETT, CT-based plan was loaded and automatic complete registration achieved. The Ion catheter was advanced to the RLL superior segment; radial EBUS revealed a heterogeneous 25 mm lesion without major vessels. An endobronchial blocker was positioned proximally. Two cryobiopsy samples were obtained using a 1.7 mm cryoprobe through the extended working channel with brief freeze times, followed by one cytology brushing. There was moderate but self-limited bleeding controlled by balloon tamponade and iced saline. No radiographic evidence of pneumothorax was seen. The patient remained stable and was admitted overnight for observation.",

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lingular pulmonary nodule. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same. PROCEDURE: Robotic navigational bronchoscopy using Monarch platform (CPT 31627), radial EBUS (CPT 31654), transbronchial lung biopsy (CPT 31628). With the patient under general anesthesia and ETT, CT-based plan was loaded and airway registration completed. The robotic catheter and sheath were advanced along the planned path to the lingular segment. Radial EBUS demonstrated an adjacent 10 mm lesion immediately subpleural. Augmented fluoroscopy without CBCT was used to refine position, confirming tool-in-lesion. Four forceps biopsies were obtained with minimal bleeding. No brushing or BAL was performed.

Under general anesthesia with ETT, CT-based plan was loaded and airway registration completed. The robotic catheter was advanced to the medial RML; radial EBUS revealed an eccentric 20 mm lesion. CBCT demonstrated catheter tip across the most solid portion of the nodule. Multiple forceps biopsies and one brushing were obtained without significant bleeding. The patient was extubated and returned to baseline oxygen requirement.",

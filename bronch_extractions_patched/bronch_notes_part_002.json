    "note_text": "INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  This is a 74 year old-year-old male chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a right upper lobe (RUL) nodule.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\nCONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD\n\nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENT : \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nIon Robotic Bronchoscope\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.\n\nNavigation and Targeting:\nA CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.\nRobotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.\nCone Beam CT Imaging:\nA cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.\nTransbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):\nA TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsy:\nTransbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1\u202fmm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):\nA BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. \nRapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):\nROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process\nAdditional BAL:\nAfter completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.\nChartis Evaluation:\nA Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. \n\nSPECIMEN(S): \nTBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.\nTransbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.\nBAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: This is a 74 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.\n\nTransfer to PACU\nObtain chest X-ray\nDischarge home once cleared by PACU\nAwait path and culture results and based on findings f/u for EBV insertion for COPD",

    "note_text": "INDICATION FOR OPERATION: This  is a 68 old-year-old male who presents with multiple sub centimeter solid and cavitary pulmonary nodules.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n \nCONSENT: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Multiple Lung Nodule\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Multiple Lung Nodule\n  \nANESTHESIA: \nGeneral Anesthesia with local anesthesia (Lidocaine 1% solution, total 60 mg)\n \nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n \nINSTRUMENTS: \nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope\nRadial EBUS\nIon\n \nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum Blood Loss\n \nCOMPLICATIONS:    Post-procedure PTX (no intervention required)\n \nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\nNormal appearing airway and mucosa to the segmental level bilaterally\n \nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Full registration was used.  \n\nTarget 1:   Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Lateral Basal Segment of RLL.  Target lesion is about .6 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. Endoscopically abnormal tissue could be visualized within the airway.\n \nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is unable to be visualized.  The following features were noted: aerated lung.\n \nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE indicated inflammatory tissue with atypical cells. Samples sent for Cytology. Transbronchial biopsies were then performed with standard forceps in similar fashion. Samples were sent for histology and culture. \n \nTarget 2: Ion robotic catheter was then used to engage the Posterior Segment of RUL.  Target lesion is about .5 cm in diameter and cavitary.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. \n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is unable to be visualized.  The following features were noted: aerated lung.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE was non-diagnostic. Samples sent for Cytology.\n \nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed in the RLL.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 30 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.\n \nPrior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.\n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2) and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood clots. \n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. Post-operative CXR demonstrated moderate PTX which was stable on repeat in asymptomatic patient. Patient was discharged with close follow-up and instructions for parameters to seek emergency care.   \n \nSPECIMEN(S): \nRLL: TBNA, Brush, Biopsy, BAL\nRUL: TBNA\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Eduardo Santiago is a 68 old-year-old male who presents with multiple sub centimeter solid and cavitary pulmonary nodules \n-Follow up biopsy results\n-Follow-up PTX with visit next week \n-RTC and emergency return parameters given.",

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a completely obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass. We were able to bypass the mass with the flexible bronchoscope and the distal airways were filled with purulent secretions consistent with post-obstructive pneumonia, the secretions were suctioned through the bronchoscope. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchi before attaching the monsoon JET ventilation. Using the flexible bronchoscope gentle manipulation resulting in brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical epinephrine and TXA. The mass was soft and somewhat pulsatile. We then inserted the linear EBUS bronchoscope into the airway and assessed the lesion with ultrasound. There was no obvious tumor seen and multiple vessels visualized in proximity to the lesion. At this point we decided to abort the procedure as endobronchial debulking would likely result in massive hemorrhage. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed from the airway and the procedure completed. Post-procedure a CT Angiogram of the chest was performed which showed purtruding submucosal broncholith with right middle and lower lobe atelectasis. There was also a very small apical pneumothorax which likely was caused by post-procedure coughing as no intervention was actually performed. \nComplications: Small pneumothorax, likely related to post-procedure coughing. \nRecommendations:\n- Admit to IM ward\n- Repeat CXR is 6 hours to assess pneumothorax\n- Treat for post-obstructive pneumothorax with course of oral antibiotics\n- I will reach out to thoracic surgeons at high volume centers to discuss possible surgical removal of broncholith.",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in the station 4R, 11R, 7 lymph nodes All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the right middle lobe to the area of known nodule and lesion distal endobronchial lesion was identified with both white light and radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of right lobe middle lobe nodule\n- Successful EBUS bronchoscopy with biopsy  \n- Await final pathology",

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. There was normal vocal cord motion and no vocal cord lesions. Additional topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 18 cc. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. The tracheal mucosa was boggy and edematous. There were thick purulent secretions noted throughout the airways. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and sub-segment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and mucosa was boggy and erythematous as seen in the trachea with thick purulent secretions throughout the airway. Bronchial lavage of the lower lobe secretions was obtained (20cc in 10cc out). There were no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem and each segment and sub-segment in the left upper lobe, lingula and lower lobe was visualized. The left sided airway anatomy was normal and mucosa was boggy and erythematous as seen in the other airways with thick purulent secretions throughout the airway. The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with instillation of 90 cc of saline and return of 40 cc of lavage fluid. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn from the wedged position and after removing from trap remaining secretions were suctioned clear. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications.\nFindings:\nDiffusely edematous and erythematous airways with copious thick secretions.\nNo endobronchial lesions visualized\n\nRecommendations:\nWill await culture, cytology and cell count from lavage\nWill initiate mucous clearance regiment with 3% saline neb TID, Flutter valve",

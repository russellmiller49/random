Fluoroscopic guidance was utilized to demarcate the lesion. A guidewire was advanced, facilitating the deployment of a 16x40 mm uncovered Ultraflex self-expanding metallic stent. Subsequent balloon dilation was performed using an 18 mm Elation catheter, achieving excellent patency and restoration of airway caliber.",

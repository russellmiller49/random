The trachea and main bronchi were patent. In the right middle lobe medial segment bronchus, a tan friable foreign body consistent with pistachio nut fragment was visualized, partially obstructing the lumen with adjacent mucosal edema. A 1.8 mm flexible retrieval basket was passed through the working channel, deployed distal to the foreign body, and closed to capture the fragment. The basket and bronchoscope were withdrawn en bloc. A small residual fragment was suctioned and removed on a second basket pass. No additional foreign material was seen after repeat inspection. No biopsies, lavage, or other therapeutic bronchoscopic interventions were performed.\nFindings: Organic nut fragment obstructing the right middle lobe medial segment bronchus; mild mucosal erythema without active bleeding after removal.\nComplications: None. No hypoxemia, arrhythmia, or clinically significant bleeding.\nDisposition: Observed in PACU and discharged home the same day with return precautions.\nImpression: Foreign body aspiration (organic nut fragment) status post complete removal via flexible bronchoscopy.",

The trachea, carina, and main bronchi were inspected and were without tumor or secretions. In the right lower lobe basal segment bronchus, a shiny metallic-appearing foreign body consistent with a denture clasp was lodged eccentrically, partially obstructing the lumen.

The bronchoscope and forceps were withdrawn together with the denture fragment intact. Repeat bronchoscopy confirmed no residual foreign material or bleeding.

The vocal cords and trachea were normal. At the left mainstem bronchus, a circular metallic foreign body consistent with a coin was lodged against the bronchial wall, nearly occluding the lumen.

Using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, a steerable catheter was guided to a posterior segment right upper lobe peripheral target along a planned pathway. Radial EBUS was then deployed through the extended working channel, demonstrating a concentric ultrasound signal consistent with an in-lesion position. After confirming catheter position with cone-beam CT, the radial EBUS probe was removed and a microwave ablation catheter was advanced to the lesion. A single ablation cycle was performed at 65 W for 7 minutes. Real-time impedance changes and post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated an ablation zone encompassing the nodule with at least a 5 mm circumferential margin. The catheter and bronchoscope were removed. No biopsies or lavage were performed during this session.\nFindings: Posterior segment right upper lobe peripheral nodule successfully targeted and treated with bronchoscopic microwave ablation; no endobronchial tumor in central airways.\nComplications: None. No pneumothorax or significant bleeding identified on immediate post-procedure imaging.\nDisposition: Extubated in the procedure suite and recovered in PACU; planned overnight observation on telemetry.\nImpression: Peripheral right upper lobe malignant-appearing nodule treated with navigation-guided bronchoscopic microwave ablation.",

A navigation catheter was advanced using CT-based virtual bronchoscopy planning to a superior segment right lower lobe target. Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric but in-branch image corresponding to the lesion. The catheter position was refined and rechecked. A radiofrequency ablation catheter was then advanced through the extended working channel to the lesion. Three overlapping ablation cycles (each 50 W for 5 minutes) were delivered with careful monitoring of impedance and tip temperature, reaching approximately 105 °C. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated an ablation zone encompassing the nodule. No biopsies or additional sampling were performed during this session.\nFindings: Peripheral superior segment right lower lobe malignant nodule treated with radiofrequency ablation; no significant central airway pathology.\nComplications: None. No pneumothorax, significant hemorrhage, or sustained hypoxia.\nDisposition: Extubated and monitored in PACU before overnight admission for observation.\nImpression: Peripheral right lower lobe adenocarcinoma treated with navigation-guided bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation.",

CXR shows hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift. CT chest confirms suspected foreign body in right mainstem bronchus. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal were discussed with the patient's parents in detail. Parents indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration, right mainstem bronchus\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration (peanut fragment), right mainstem bronchus\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Foreign Body Removal\nATTENDING: Dr. Steven Martinez\nASSISTANT: Dr. Laura White, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Katherine Brown\nRT: Andrew Garcia\nAnesthesia: Dr. Michelle Chen\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring\nINSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended\nA 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.\nInitial Survey:\n\nLarynx: Normal\nVocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement\nTrachea: Normal caliber, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\n\nThe bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.\nForeign Body Retrieval:\nOptical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.\nThe foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.\nThe bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:\n\nRight mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material\nRight upper lobe: Patent\nRight middle lobe: Patent\nRight lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions\nLeft lung: Examined and found to be normal\n\nSecretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was identified. Final inspection showed:\n\nComplete foreign body removal\nMild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding\nPatent bilateral airways\n\nThe bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.\nThe attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nForeign body: Peanut fragment (retained for documentation)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Emma underwent successful rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal. A peanut fragment was removed from the right mainstem bronchus without complication. Post-procedure CXR ordered to confirm resolution of hyperinflation. Observe overnight with monitoring. Discharge tomorrow if stable. No bronchodilators needed. Counsel parents on choking prevention. Follow up with pediatrician in 1 week.",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: Christopher Hayes\nMRN: 9274183\nDate of Procedure: June 15, 2020\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy\n\nSurgeon: Kevin Martinez, MD\nIndications: Left mainstem obstruction\nConsent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without any endoluminal obstruction. On the right, there was minimal structuring of the bronchus intermedius. On the left, the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially, and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded.\n\nRadial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation. However, due to the proximal obstruction, dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a guide wire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point, we performed APC to the left mainstem followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly recanalize the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly reopened, but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets. However, once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem, a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2 mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture.\n\nAt this point, to protect from major vascular bleeding, we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem, after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax. In the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation, we felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area, a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Patient to remain intubated tonight\n\u2022 CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung\n\u2022 Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery\n\u2022 Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention\n\u2022 If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight, place left side down, intubate right mainstem, call me (602-791-3135) and pediatric surgeon immediately\n\u2022 We will continue to follow\n\nKevin Martinez, MD\n\n________________________________________",

Esophageal stent migration through distal trachea and left mainstem\n2.         Left mainstem occlusion secondary to  esophageal stent\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n1.        Tracheoesophageal fistula status post tracheal Y-stent placement\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n1.        Rigid bronchoscopy with esophageal stent removal \n2.        Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement\n3.        Bronchoscopic intubation\nSURGEON: Jordan Parks MD\nINDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction secondary to esophageal stent migration\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   \nComplications:  Extension of TE fistula \nRecommendations:\n-        Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.\n-        Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU\n-        Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible \n-        Appreciate GI recommendations. \n-        Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware\n-        Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient\u2019s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-        If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-        Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).\n-        Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-        If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.        \nJordan Parks, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nUCLA Medical Center",

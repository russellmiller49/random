Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 07:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 09:33\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 123 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4021 (21G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 7: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 19.5mm (short axis) x 24.9mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\nStation 11L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 18.1mm (short axis) x 17.4mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\nStation 10R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 17.1mm (short axis) x 27.3mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\nStation 4L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 11.5mm (short axis) x 24.9mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LUL anterior (B3)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 25.0 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 7.6 mm\n- CT appearance: Solid\n- Bronchus sign: Positive\n- PET SUV max: 9.6\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming eccentric view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 4 specimens\n- TBNA: 3 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 7, 11L, 10R, 4L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LUL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LUL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LUL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nAndrew Nakamura\nInterventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:14\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 119 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Boston Scientific Acquire (22G Acquire)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 11L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 21.6mm (short axis) x 19.9mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.5mm (short axis) x 12.2mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 7: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 21.8mm (short axis) x 25.3mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 11R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.0mm (short axis) x 14.3mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\nStation 10R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 21.4mm (short axis) x 18.1mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 31.9 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 30.3 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n- PET SUV max: 13.4\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 6 specimens\n- TBNA: 3 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Suspicious for malignancy\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 11L, 2L, 7, 11R, 10R - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nMaria Santos\nInterventional Pulmonology\nMemorial Hospital\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 2\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:09\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 114 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Cook EchoTip ProCore (22G FNB/ProCore)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 2L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.8mm (short axis) x 28.3mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 4L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.3mm (short axis) x 25.6mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\nStation 10R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 12.9mm (short axis) x 30.7mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 10L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 18.8mm (short axis) x 34.6mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 11L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 18.7mm (short axis) x 20.8mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LUL apicoposterior (B1+2)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 14.0 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 23.9 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n- PET SUV max: 17.6\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming concentric view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 7 specimens\n- TBNA: 2 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 2L, 4L, 10R, 10L, 11L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LUL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LUL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LUL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nRachel Goldman\nInterventional Pulmonology\nAcademic Health System\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 09:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 11:03\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 108 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Olympus BF-UC190F\n- EBUS needle: Cook EchoTip ProCore (22G FNB/ProCore)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 4L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 9.1mm (short axis) x 13.1mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 14.9mm (short axis) x 15.8mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 2L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 13.2mm (short axis) x 25.8mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RLL superior (B6)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 27.1 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 26.4 mm\n- CT appearance: Solid\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n- PET SUV max: 6.1\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Augmented fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 5 specimens\n- TBNA: 2 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 4L, 2R, 2L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nAmanda Foster\nInterventional Pulmonology\nBaptist Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 4\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 10:45\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 12:12\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 87 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Olympus BF-UC190F\n- EBUS needle: Boston Scientific Acquire (22G Acquire)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 2L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 13.8mm (short axis) x 21.0mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\nStation 4R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 23.9mm (short axis) x 31.2mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 11R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 19.6mm (short axis) x 30.0mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 11L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 17.4mm (short axis) x 22.1mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RML medial (B5)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 20.0 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 15.9 mm\n- CT appearance: Solid\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n- PET SUV max: 6.5\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Augmented fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 7 specimens\n- TBNA: 2 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - NSCLC NOS\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 2L, 4R, 11R, 11L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RML - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RML - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RML - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nDavid Kim\nInterventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 4\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:08\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 98 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Olympus BF-UC190F\n- EBUS needle: Boston Scientific Acquire (22G Acquire)\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 4R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 22.1mm (short axis) x 22.1mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 2R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 14.8mm (short axis) x 16.0mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.4mm (short axis) x 34.5mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\nStation 10L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 10.7mm (short axis) x 16.3mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LUL inferior lingula (B5)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 30.2 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 30.3 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Positive\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming eccentric view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: CBCT\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 8 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - small cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 4R, 2R, 2L, 10L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LUL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LUL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LUL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nSarah Chen\nInterventional Pulmonology\nAcademic Health System\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 4\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:10\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 100 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Boston Scientific Acquire (22G Acquire)\n- Robotic platform: Galaxy (Noah Medical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 11R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 22.0mm (short axis) x 13.6mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\nStation 4R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 13.7mm (short axis) x 29.3mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 11L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 18.9mm (short axis) x 31.0mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RLL superior (B6)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 27.5 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 9.7 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n- PET SUV max: 16.3\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming eccentric view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: CBCT\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 4 specimens\n- TBNA: 3 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 11R, 4R, 11L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nSteven Park\nInterventional Pulmonology\nBaptist Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 4\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:15\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 105 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4022 (22G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 4R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 23.5mm (short axis) x 32.6mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\nStation 4L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.3mm (short axis) x 14.4mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 10R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 11.1mm (short axis) x 12.3mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 20.1mm (short axis) x 33.5mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RML medial (B5)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 31.5 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 36.7 mm\n- CT appearance: Part-solid\n- Bronchus sign: Positive\n- PET SUV max: 7.9\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Augmented fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 5 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 4R, 4L, 10R, 2L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RML - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RML - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RML - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nLisa Thompson\nInterventional Pulmonology\nBaptist Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 4\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 09:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 11:02\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 92 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4021 (21G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 10R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 17.1mm (short axis) x 25.9mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 11R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.4mm (short axis) x 34.2mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\nStation 11L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 22.2mm (short axis) x 34.6mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 2R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 21.9mm (short axis) x 28.9mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 4L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 18.5mm (short axis) x 22.0mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RLL lateral basal (B9)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 28.6 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 24.0 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n- PET SUV max: 8.9\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Augmented fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 5 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - adenocarcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 10R, 11R, 11L, 2R, 4L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nMichael Rodriguez\nInterventional Pulmonology\nMemorial Hospital\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Galaxy platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 10:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 12:49\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 139 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4022 (22G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Galaxy (Noah Medical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 2R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 12.0mm (short axis) x 33.3mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 10R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 12.9mm (short axis) x 26.6mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 13.9mm (short axis) x 22.9mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RLL medial basal (B7)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 23.3 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 34.7 mm\n- CT appearance: Solid\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Radial EBUS\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 5 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 2R, 10R, 2L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nDavid Kim\nInterventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 09:32\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 77 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Cook EchoTip ProCore (22G FNB/ProCore)\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 4L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 18.3mm (short axis) x 28.3mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 10R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 14.8mm (short axis) x 23.9mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 4R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 20.9mm (short axis) x 20.6mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 7: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.0mm (short axis) x 28.4mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RUL anterior (B3)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 30.9 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 17.5 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 6 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Granuloma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 4L, 10R, 4R, 7 - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RUL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RUL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RUL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nSteven Park\nInterventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 2\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 09:00\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:45\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 105 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4021 (21G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 10R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.1mm (short axis) x 29.1mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 4L: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 21.5mm (short axis) x 25.6mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\nStation 4R: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 12.6mm (short axis) x 19.0mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 11L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 22.8mm (short axis) x 27.5mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RML lateral (B4)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 15.4 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 38.4 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Positive\n- PET SUV max: 4.3\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Radial EBUS\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 7 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Atypical cells\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 10R, 4L, 4R, 11L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RML - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RML - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RML - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nBrian O'Connor\nInterventional Pulmonology\nPresbyterian Hospital\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 10:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 11:36\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 81 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4022 (22G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 10R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.5mm (short axis) x 31.6mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 10L: Identified hypoechoic lymph node measuring 21.7mm (short axis) x 14.6mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 11R: Identified homogeneous lymph node measuring 20.5mm (short axis) x 29.9mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LLL lateral basal (B9)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 29.4 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 20.2 mm\n- CT appearance: Part-solid\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 6 specimens\n- TBNA: 2 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 10R, 10L, 11R - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nBrian O'Connor\nInterventional Pulmonology\nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n",

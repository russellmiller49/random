Continuous pulse oximetry, ECG, and noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. Supplemental O2 via nasal cannula.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter topical lidocaine to the oropharynx, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the mouth in the native airway. Vocal cords, trachea, and main bronchi were inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial mass or foreign body was seen. Copious mucopurulent secretions were present in the right lower lobe (RLL) bronchus; these were suctioned.\nBAL was performed in the RLL posterior segment with four 30 mL aliquots of sterile saline (total 120 mL), with approximately 60 mL of turbid return. Samples sent for cell count/differential, bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB smear/culture, and cytology.\nNo biopsies, brushings, navigation, or EBUS were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone. Oxygen saturation remained >92% throughout. No bleeding beyond scant blood-tinged secretions.\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE PLAN:\nObserve in PACU then discharge home if stable. Continue antibiotics. Follow up CT chest in 8 weeks or sooner if clinical status worsens.",

After entry into the left pleural space in the mid-axillary line, a rigid medical thoracoscope was introduced. Diffuse pleural nodularity was seen over the parietal pleura; multiple biopsies were obtained. Approximately 1.8 L of serosanguinous fluid was evacuated.\n\nTalc poudrage pleurodesis was then performed with insufflation of 4 g of sterile talc over the parietal pleura under thoracoscopic visualization. A 24 Fr chest tube was placed at the conclusion of the case and connected to suction.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone intra-procedure.\n\nPLAN:\nAdmit to floor. Maintain chest tube to -20 cmH2O suction overnight, then water seal if output and air leak allow. Daily chest radiographs until tube removal.",

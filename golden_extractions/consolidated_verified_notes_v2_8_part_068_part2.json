An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t13\t356\t10\t80\t5\t21\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 3.7mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RML. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB5) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Medial Segment of RML.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 7 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at RB5. 60mL NS instilled with 24mL return. Sent for Cell count, Culture, and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nWilliams, MD",

Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t10\t353\t14\t80\t8\t24\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.2mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the LLL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB10) to provide stability.

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally.

Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.2mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the LUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB3) to provide stability.

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t12\t321\t8\t80\t5\t20\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.3mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the LUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB3) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Anterior Segment of LUL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 19G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 8 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 5 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at LB3. 40mL NS instilled with 18mL return. Sent for Cell count, Culture, and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nDavis, MD",

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t11\t349\t11\t100\t6\t17\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.8mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RLL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB8) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Anterior-Basal Segment of RLL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Concentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 6 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 7 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at RB8. 60mL NS instilled with 28mL return. Sent for Cell count, Culture, and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nAnderson, MD",

Approximately 1.8 L of serosanguinous pleural fluid was drained through a trocar. A semi-rigid thoracoscope was introduced. Diffuse parietal pleural studding and nodularity were seen, with trapped lung but near-complete re-expansion after drainage. Multiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained. A talc slurry (4 g in 50 mL normal saline) was distributed evenly over the parietal pleura while rotating the patient. A 24 Fr chest tube was left in place and connected to \u221220 cmH2O suction.\nComplications: None; transient hypotension responsive to fluids.\nEstimated blood loss: 25 mL.\nDisposition: Admitted to floor with chest tube to suction.\nPlan: Daily chest radiographs, monitor drainage; remove chest tube when output <150 mL/day and lung fully expanded; oncology follow-up once pathology finalized.",

Entry into the left pleural space at the 5th intercostal space yielded a small amount of serosanguinous fluid and air. Thoracoscopic inspection revealed several apical blebs and normal visceral pleura elsewhere. The apical blebs were stapled with an endoscopic stapler by the thoracic surgery team (documented separately). Medical thoracoscopy team performed mechanical pleurodesis along the apical and parietal pleura using gauze pads, followed by insufflation of 4 g sterile talc as dry powder. A 24 Fr chest tube was left at the apex.\nComplications: Brief intraoperative desaturation to 88% during lung isolation, resolved with recruitment maneuvers.\nEstimated blood loss: 20 mL.\nDisposition: Admitted to floor with chest tube to suction.\nPlan: Daily CXRs; chest tube removal when no air leak and lung fully expanded on water seal; smoking cessation counseling.",

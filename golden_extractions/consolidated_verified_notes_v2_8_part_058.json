This resulted in >100% increased work due to Time and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)\n\nUnusual Procedure (50 MODIFIER): This patient required a bilateral procedure today when this procedure would typically be unilateral. Apply to: 76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation\n\nATTENDING:  Dr. Perry Cox MD ASSISTANT:   Dr. John Dorian MD\n\nSupport Staff: RN: Carla Espinosa RT: Laverne Roberts\n\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedures below.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL - THORACENTESIS: A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nGetty Images\n\nINSTRUMENT: Thoracentesis kit.\n\nANESTHESIA: Thoracentesis: Local lidocaine.\n\nPATIENT POSITION: Sitting\n\nLEFT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE: FINDINGS: Hemithorax: LEFT Pleural Effusion: Volume: Moderate Echogenicity: Anechoic Loculations: None Diaphragmatic Motion: Normal Lung: Lung sliding before procedure: Present Lung sliding post procedure: See other ultrasound exam below Lung consolidation/atelectasis: Present Pleura: Normal Image(s) saved and uploaded: YES - saved to the imaging PACS system\n\nRIGHT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE: FINDINGS: Hemithorax: RIGHT Pleural Effusion: Volume: Trivial Echogenicity: Anechoic Loculations: None Diaphragmatic Motion: Normal Lung: Lung sliding before procedure: Present Lung sliding post procedure: N/A Lung consolidation/atelectasis: Absent Pleura: Normal Image(s) saved and uploaded: YES - saved to the imaging PACS system\n\nLEFT THORACENTESIS PROCEDURE: Anatomic landmarks and ultrasound-guidance were utilized to determine the appropriate insertion site. Insertion site marked. Thoracentesis Kit was used.\n\nANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine 1%: 10 mL      Other:\n\nEntry Site: Left 7th Intercostal Space in the Mid-scapular line\n\nProcedure was performed using sterile technique throughout. Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was used to anesthesize the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superior aspect of the inferior rib periosteum and parietal pleura. A #10 scalpel blade was used to nick the skin at the insertion site. A thoracentesis over-the-needle catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. The needle and over-the-needle catheter were introduced through the skin incision into the pleural space while applying negative aspiration pressure. Entry into pleural space was confirmed by aspiration of amber-colored fluid. While holding the insertion needle stable, the catheter was then threaded into the pleural space without difficulty. The insertion needle was removed. Pleural fluid was aspirated through the catheter via manual aspiration without difficulty - see fluid description and aspirated volume below. The catheter was then removed while patient exhaled. Pressure briefly held until minimal bleeding stopped and bandage applied over site.\n\nFluid Description: Serosanguinous Fluid Volume Removed: 660 ml\n\nDrainage method:  Manual aspiration into drainage bag. Pleural pressures:  Not measured.\n\nReason pleural fluid aspiration was stopped:  Unable to manually aspirate any further fluid.\n\nPost-procedure LEFT Chest Ultrasound showed: LEFT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE (after thoracentesis catheter was removed): FINDINGS: Hemithorax: LEFT Pleural Effusion: Volume: None Echogenicity: N/A Loculations: N/A Diaphragmatic Motion: Normal Lung: Lung sliding before procedure: See other ultrasound exam above Lung sliding post procedure: Present Lung consolidation/atelectasis: Resolved (along lateral view).

Sedation initiated. Bite blocker placed.\n\nThe Disposable Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination. Endobronchial topical lidocaine applied to the posterior oropharynx, vocal cords, main carina, right carina 1, and left carina 2.\n\nInitial Airway Examination Findings: Pharynx: Normal. Larynx: Normal. Vocal Chords: Normal without mass/lesions. Normal adduction/abduction. Trachea: Normal. Main Carina: Sharp Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to the first subsegmental level. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to the first subsegmental level. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. Mucosa: Normal. Secretions: Moderate, thin, and clear with scattering of thicker white clumps of mucus. All secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration).\n\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2). Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8). Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4). Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nResidual secretions and saline were suctioned to clear.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient's Bite blocker was removed in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  None COMPLICATIONS:    None\n\nSPECIMEN(S): LUL (LB1/2) BAL: Cell count, cultures/micro, cytology.

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nCONSENT: Obtained before the procedure.

All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind Medical Center firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Ambu A5 disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via I-gel LMA, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. There was normal vocal cord motion and no vocal cord lesions. Additional topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 8 cc. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. The trachea was normal appearing with minimal clear thin secretions. These were suctioned clear. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and subsegment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem and each segment and subsegement in the left upper lobe, lingula and lower lobe was visualized. The left sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left. The bronchocope was removed and the BF-190 EBUS linear bronchoscope was inserted into the airway.\n\nEBUS-Findings Indications: Diagnostic Technique: The 7 (subcarinal) node was 28.5 mm and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield. Six endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with the 22-gauge Needle Vizishot-1 needle. Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of malignancy. Final results are pending.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMEN(S): Station 7 lymph node EBUS TBNA x 6\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Diana Prince is a 63-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of enlarged station 7 mediastinal lymph node.\n\nTransfer to recovery\n\nD/C when criteria met\n\nAwait final path\n\nDr. Allison Cameron, MD 06/10/2024",

The mucosa of the distal trachea, distal LMSB, RMSB and RUL had several nodules that were soft.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius from mucus.\n\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4). Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nEndobronchial biopsy was performed at inferior portion of the RUL bronchus. Lesion was successfully removed. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nEBUS-Findings Indications: Diagnostic and Staging Technique: All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.\n\nLymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle, 21-gauge Needle, and Cryoprobe 1.1mm.\n\nLymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node 4L (lower paratracheal) node 11Rs lymph node 11L lymph node\n\nOverall ROSE Diagnosis: Positive for malignancy\n\nNo immediate complications\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1\u20133), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy.\n\nLymph Nodes Sampled: Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 7 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis. Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. With extensive necrosis. Due to need for large amount of cells for IHC and NGS additional sites were evaluated and sampled. Final results are pending.\n\nSite 2: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield.\n\nSite 3: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield. Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.\n\nSite 4: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed with the 1.1 mm cryoprobe x 6.\n\nSite 5: The 11Rs lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. Additional sampling was not performed based on evaluation of the 4R lymph node appearance. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was successfully extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMEN(S): BAL RML EBBx RUL EBUS TBNA 11L and 4R EBUS TBBX 4R\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ellen Ripley is a 66-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis.

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\n\nCONSENT: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule\n\nPROCEDURE: 31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode 31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing 31623 Dx bronchoscope/brushing 31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL) 31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes 76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion 76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Targets\n\nATTENDING: Dr. Julius Hibbert MD\n\nASSISTANT:   -\n\nSupport Staff: RN: Nurse Kellye RT: -\n\nANESTHESIA: General Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENT: Linear EBUS Disposable Bronchoscope\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Moderate\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:    None\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind Medical Center firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.\n\nPATIENT POSITION: .\n\nInitial Airway Inspection Findings: Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level, except for some narrowing at the left lower lobe.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\n\nEBUS-Findings Indications: Diagnostic and Staging Technique: All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled. Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.\n\nLymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4L (lower paratracheal) node 7 (subcarinal) node 11Rs lymph node 11Ri lymph node 11L lymph node Left lower lobe mass\n\nOverall ROSE Diagnosis: Positive for malignancy\n\nNo immediate complications\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1\u20133), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy.\n\nLymph Nodes Sampled: Site 1: The 11Ri lymph node was < 10 mm on CT and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.\n\nSite 2: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.\n\nSite 3: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue). Base on ultrasound appearance, biopsy was not taken.\n\nSite 4: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.\n\nSite 5: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.\n\nSite 6: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis. Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Suggestive of benign-appearing lymphoid tissue. Final results are pending.\n\nSite 7: The Left lower lobe mass was => 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 12 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis. Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots.\n\nEndobronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush at Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9). Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of RLL (RB6), Medial-basal Segment of RLL (RB7), Anterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB8), and Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9). Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMEN(S): EBUS-TBNA 11L, left lower lobe mass Left lower lobe brush Left lower lobe bronchoalveolar lavage\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Natasha Romanoff is a 75-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung mass.\n\nFollow up bronchoscopic lab work\n\nDr. Julius Hibbert, MD 06/10/2024",
